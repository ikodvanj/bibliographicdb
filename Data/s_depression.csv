The participants consisted of 960 individuals, including 663 females (69.1%) and 297 males (30.9%). The age of the participants ranged between 18 and 76 (29.74 ± 9.64). As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress, and a negative relationship was determined between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anxiety; Depression; Fear of COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Positivity; Stress",,,,,,,,,"(2020) Kütahya’da korkunç Olay!

Researchers from around the world have tried to study the virus and its effect with more precision in various fields. The purpose of this study is to identify levels of anxiety and depression with regard to precautionary for prevention of COVID-19, and to identify the relationship between demographic variables and both depression and anxiety. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study; data were collected by questionnaire via a mobile phone application in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 25 March, 2020 to 5 April, 2020. The sample size was 894 after deleting 20 cases because of duplication. The questionnaire consists of three main parts; part one is related to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, the second and third parts consist of items related to depression and anxiety about COVID-19 using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = of course no, 2 = no , 3 = normal for me, 4 = yes, and 5 = of course yes). Data was analyzed using SPSS V.25. Results: The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Kurdistan Region of Iraq; Population",,,,,,,,,"Bedford, J., COVID-19: towards controlling of a pandemic (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1015-1018. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXltFChsbc%3D; Blbas, H.T.A., Statistical analysis for the most influential reasons for divorce between men and women in Erbil-Iraq International Journal of Innovation (2019) Creativity and Change, 6, pp. 207-216; Chou, W.-Y.S., Oh, A., Klein, W.M., Addressing health-related misinformation on social media (2018) JAMA, 320, pp. 2417-2418; Jernigan, D.B., Update: public health response to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak—United States, February 24, 2020 (2020) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 69, pp. 216-219; Jiloha, R., COVID-19 and mental health (2020) Epidem Int, 5 (1), pp. 7-9; Larson, H.J., The biggest pandemic risk?

This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores ≥ 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores ≥ 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores ≥ 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety. These factors provide initial guidance regarding the clinical management for COVID-19-related mental health problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Ethnicity; Psychological stress, Loneliness; PTSD; Social support; University health services","adult; anxiety assessment; anxiety disorder; Article; Asian American; Caucasian; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; disease association; domestic partner; family; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7; Hispanic; human; loneliness; major clinical study; male; mental health; mental stress; online system; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 8; patient worry; peer group; posttraumatic stress disorder; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Civilian version; priority journal; psychological resilience; race difference; social support; symptomatology; United States; young adult",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 2027553

Therefore, it is time to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were randomly recruited and asked to complete a structured questionnaire, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the global rating of change scale and items related to COVID-19. Of the 500 respondents included in the study, 19% had depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10) and 14% had anxiety (GAD score ≥ 10). In addition, 25.4% reported that their mental health had deteriorated since the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status. Psychological support, such as brief, home-based psychological interventions, should be provided to citizens during the pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19 fear; Depression; Emotional reactivity; Experiential avoidance; OCD",,,,,,,,,"Ahorsu, D.K., Lin, C.Y., Imani, V., Saffari, M., Griffiths, M.D., Pakpour, A.H., The Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Development and Initial Validation (2020) International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, pp. 1-9. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5®), , American Psychiatric Pub; Ay, I., Seçer, I., Şimşek, M.K., Adapting depression and anxiety questionnaire for children into Turkish: Reliability and validity studies (2017) International Education Studies, 10 (3), pp. 185-193; Banerjee, D., The other side of COVID-19: Impact on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding (2020) Psychiatry Research, 288, p. 112966; Briggs, E.S., Price, I.R., The relationship between adverse childhood experience and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and beliefs: The role of anxiety, depression, and experiential avoidance (2009) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 23 (8), pp. 1037-1046; Brooks, S.K., Webster, R.K., Smith, L.E., Woodland, L., Wessely, S., Greenberg, N., Rubin, G.J., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10227), pp. 912-920; Bylsma, L.M., Morris, B.H., Rottenberg, J., A meta-analysis of emotional reactivity in major depressive disorder (2008) Clinical Psychology Review, 28 (4), pp. 676-691; Cordeiro, T., Sharma, M., Thennarasu, K., Janardhan-Reddy, Y., Symptom dimensions in obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive beliefs.

However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Blood routine analysis; Convalescent COVID-19 patients; Immunity response; Self-reported depression",,,,,,,,,"Arabska, J., Lucka, A., Magierski, R., Sobow, T., Wysokinski, A., Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio is increased in elderly patients with first episode depression, but not in recurrent depression (2018) Psychiatry Res., 263, pp. 35-40; Dowlati, Y., Herrmann, N., Swardfager, W., Liu, H., Sham, L., Reim, E.K., Lanctôt, K.L., A meta-analysis of cytokines in major depression (2010) Biol.

INFs are known to shift the metabolism of tryptophan (TRP) away from its role as a precursor of serotonin. For some patients, reduction in TRP levels may either expose an underlying vulnerability to depression or trigger a de novo episode of depression. This Commentary discusses the pathway involved and recommends in-hospital augmentation with foods or supplements that increase TRP levels for COVID-19 patients treated with INFs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be tried if the depressive symptomatology is not short-lived. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Depression; Interferons; Kynurenine","alpha interferon; alpha2 interferon; beta interferon; beta1 interferon; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; interferon; kynurenine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tryptophan; tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase; umifenovir; aging; alcohol consumption; amino acid synthesis; anxiety disorder; China; coronavirus disease 2019; demoralization; depression; disease course; distress syndrome; domestic violence; drug exposure; fatigue; fever; financial deficit; food insecurity; health care personnel; helplessness; hepatitis C; hopelessness; human; life threat; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; Middle East respiratory syndrome; multicenter study (topic); multiple sclerosis; Note; pandemic; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); posttraumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; priority journal; quarantine; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); SARS coronavirus; sex ratio; social behavior; suicide; symptomatology; treatment duration; treatment outcome; United States; upregulation; viral clearance; vulnerable population",,"indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; kynurenine, 16055-80-4, 343-65-7; tryptophan, 6912-86-3, 73-22-3; tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase, 9014-51-1; umifenovir, 131707-25-0",,,,,,"Alavian, S.M., Hamadanizadeh, A.K., Abar, K., Efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for treatment of chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis in Iranian (2004) Hepat.

This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. Material/Methods: Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as ‘affected group’ and ‘unaffected group’ on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. Results: Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. Conclusions: The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population’s mental state. © Med Sci Monit,","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Public Health","adult; age;

We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusions: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemics; Smartphone addiction","adolescent; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlational study; cross-sectional study; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; disease association; disease severity; emotional stress; female; human; Internet; major clinical study; male; mental disease assessment; mental health research; mobile phone addiction; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; smartphone addiction scale short version; social distance; social isolation; social media; structural equation modeling",,,,,"Tianjin Normal University

Both the pandemic and the measures taken to combat it can affect individuals’ mental health. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these. Method: The study was performed using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. Results: In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (n = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (n = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. Conclusion: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning. © The Author(s) 2020.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; Health anxiety",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.L., Dennerstein, L., Kotz, K., Richardson, G., Women, anxiety and mood: A review of nomenclature, comorbidity and epidemiology (2007) Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics, 7, , https://doi.org/10.1586/14737175.7.11s.S45, S45–S58; Asmundson, G.J.G., Taylor, S., How health anxiety influences responses to viral outbreaks like COVID-19: What all decision-makers, health authorities, and health care professionals need to know (2020) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 71. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102211, 102211; Aydemir, O., Güvenir, T., Küey, L., Kültür, S., Reliability and Validity of the Turkish version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (1997) Turkish Journal of Psychiatry, 8, pp. 280-287. , [,]; Aydemir, O., Kırpınar, I., Sati, T., Uykur, B., Cengisiz, C., Reliability and Validity of the Turkish Version of the Health Anxiety Inventory (2013) Archives of Neuropsychiatry, 50, pp. 325-331. , https://doi.org/10.4274/npa.y6383; Bobevski, I., Clarke, D.M., Meadows, G., Health anxiety and its relationship to disability and service use: Findings from a large epidemiological survey (2016) Psychosomatic Medicine, 78 (1), pp. 13-25. , https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000252; Cao, W., Fang, Z., Hou, G., Han, M., Xu, X., Dong, J., Zheng, J., The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China (2020) Psychiatry Research, 287. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112934, 112934; Cattell, R.B., Theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence: A critical experiment (1963) Journal of Educational Psychology, 54 (1), pp. 1-22; Severe outcomes among patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) – United States (2020) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 69 (12), pp. 343-346. , https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6912e2, February, 12, March, 16, 2020; Chen, Y., Jin, Y.L., Zhu, L.J., Fang, Z.M., Wu, N., Du, M.X., Yao, Y.S., [The network investigation on knowledge, attitude and practice about COVID-19 of the residents in Anhui Province] (2020) Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi, 54 (4). , https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200205-00069, 367–373; Chew, Q.H., Wei, K.C., Vasoo, S., Chua, H.C., Sim, K., Narrative synthesis of psychological and coping responses towards emerging infectious disease outbreaks in the general population: Practical considerations for the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) Singapore Medical Journal, , https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020046, Advance online publication; GjG, T.S.A., (2004) Treating health anxiety, , Guilford; Kim, S.J., Han, J.A., Lee, T.Y., Hwang, T.Y., Kwon, K.S., Park, K.S., Lee, S.Y., Community-based risk communication survey: Risk prevention behaviors in communities during the H1N1 crisis, 2010 (2014) Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, 5 (1), pp. 9-19. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2013.12.001; Lee, A.M., Wong, J.G., McAlonan, G.M., Cheung, V., Cheung, C., Sham, P.C., Chua, S.E., Stress and psychological distress among SARS survivors 1 year after the outbreak (2007) Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 52 (4), pp. 233-240. , https://doi.org/10.1177/070674370705200405; Liu, N., Zhang, F., Wei, C., Jia, Y., Shang, Z., Sun, L., Liu, W., Prevalence and predictors of PTSS during COVID-19 outbreak in China hardest-hit areas: Gender differences matter (2020) Psychiatry Research, 287. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921, 112921; McDonnell, W.M., Nelson, D.S., Schunk, J.E., Should we fear ‘flu fear’ itself?

Evidence for the impact of these changes on our physical and mental health and health behaviors is limited. We examined the associations between psychological distress and changes in selected health behaviors since the onset of COVID-19 in Australia. An online survey was distributed in April 2020 and included measures of depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, sleep, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking. The survey was completed by 1491 adults (mean age 50.5 ± 14.9 years, 67% female). Negative change was reported for physical activity (48.9%), sleep (40.7%), alcohol (26.6%) and smoking (6.9%) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly higher scores in one or more psychological distress states were found for females, and those not in a relationship, in the lowest income category, aged 18–45 years, or with a chronic illness. Negative changes in physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake were associated with higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.

Methods: An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results: A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions: Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Depression in neurosurgeons; Depression in surgeons; Depression scale; Depression/anxiety; Global neurosurgery; Health care workers; Pandemic; PPE; Safety; Social media",,,,,,,,,"Mamoon, N., Rasskin, G., COVID-19 https://www.covidvisualizer.com/, Carnegie Mellon University. 2020.

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health. © 2020","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Stress","adult; aged; anxiety; anxiety assessment; Article; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; death; depression; Depression and Anxiety Stress scale; depression assessment; emotionality; fear; Fear of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Scale; female; high risk population; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; Israeli; male; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; normal human; pandemic; priority journal; psychological aspect; psychometry; reliability; sex difference; social status; symptom; validity; variance; very elderly; young adult",,,,,,,,"Adler, N.E., Snibbe, A.C., The role of psychosocial processes in explaining the gradient between socioeconomic status and health (2003) Curr.

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event. Psychological interventions to counteract short-and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary. © 2020 by the authors.

A total of 290 pregnant women and their husbands (N = 580) were randomly selected from a list of pregnant women in the Iranian Integrated Health System and were invited to respond to psychometric scales assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives’ actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects. Also, the data are mainly based on self-reported measures which have some limitations due to its potential for social desirability and recall biases. Based on the findings, couples may benefit from psychoeducation that focuses on the effect of mental health problems on pregnant women and the foetus. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anxiety; APIM; COVID-19 preventive behaviour; Depression; Dyad; Pregnancy; Suicidal intention",,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, R., Kenny, D., (2016) Apimpowerr: An Interactive Tool for Actor-Partner Interdependence Model Power Analysis, , https://robert-ackerman.shinyapps.io/APIMPowerR/, [Computer software].

The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. Methods: The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. Results: After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (α =.82) and test–retest reliability (ICC =.72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). Conclusion: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Fear; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Iran; Psychometrics",,,,,,,,,"Ahmadzadeh, M., Ghamarani, A., Samadi, M., Shamsi, A., Azizollah, A., The investigation of validity and reliability of a scale of perceived vulnerability to disease in Iran (2013) British Journal of Social Sciences, 1, pp. 43-51; Baud, D., Qi, X., Nielsen-Saines, K., Musso, D., Pomar, L., Favre, G., Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection (2020) The Lancet Infectious Diseases., , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30195-X; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Manage anxiety & stress.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N = 908 Chinese adults (mean age = 40.37 years, SD = 9.27; n = 752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19. These results lend support for individual variation in the activation of the BIS.

The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Depression; Mixed-method; Peripheral inflammation; Stress",,,,,,"YG2020YQ25

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychological impact; Psychological intervention; Review; Stress",,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, M.Z., Ahmed, O., Zhou, A., Sang, H., Liu, S., Siyu, L., Ahmad, A., Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated psychological problems (2020) Asian J.

The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) assesses the severity of fear towards COVID-19. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of the FCV-19S. Using a forward-backward translation, the FCV-19S was translated into Arabic. An online survey using the Arabic versions of FCV-19S and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered. Reliability and concurrent and confirmatory validity were examined. The dataset consisted of 693 Saudi participants. The internal consistency of the Arabic FCV-19S was satisfactory (α =.88), with sound concurrent validity indicated by significant and positive correlations with HADS (r =.66). The unidimensional structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed. The Arabic version of the FCV-19S is psychometrically robust and can be used in research assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 among a Saudi adult population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Arabic FCV-19S; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Saudi Arabia",,,,,,,,,"Ahorsu, D.K., Lin, C.-Y., Imani, V., Saffari, M., Griffiths, M.D., Pakpour, A.H., The fear of COVID-19 scale: Development and initial validation (2020) International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8; Al-Awadhi, A.M., Alsaifi, K., Al-Awadhi, A., Alhammadi, S., Death and contagious infectious diseases: impact of the COVID-19 virus on stock market returns (2020) Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 27, p. 100326; Alyami, M., Al-Sharef, A., Al-Aseri, M., Henning, M., Mammography self-efficacy scale and breast cancer fear scale: psychometric properties of the Arabic versions among Saudi women (2019) Cancer Nursing, , &, (,).,.,., https://doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000000767; Bjelland, I., Dahl, A.A., Haug, T.T., Neckelmann, D., The validity of the hospital anxiety and depression scale: an updated literature review (2002) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 52 (2), pp. 69-77; Bukhari, E.E., Temsah, M.H., Aleyadhy, A.A., Alrabiaa, A.A., Alhboob, A.A., Jamal, A.A., Binsaeed, A.A., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak perceptions of risk and stress evaluation in nurses (2016) Journal of Infection in Developing Countries, 10 (8), pp. 845-850; Byrne, B.M., Campbell, T.L., Cross-cultural comparisons and the presumption of equivalent measurement and theoretical structure: a look beneath the surface (1999) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 30 (5), pp. 555-574; Calati, R., Ferrari, C., Brittner, M., Oasi, O., Olié, E., Carvalho, A.F., Courtet, P., Suicidal thoughts and behaviors and social isolation: a narrative review of the literature (2019) Journal of Affective Disorders, 245, pp. 653-667; Champion, V.L., Skinner, C.S., Menon, U., Rawl, S., Giesler, R.B., Monahan, P., Daggy, J., A breast cancer fear scale: psychometric development (2004) Journal of Health Psychology, 9 (6), pp. 753-762; Champion, V.L., Monahan, P.O., Springston, J.K., Russell, K., Zollinger, T.W., Saywell, R.M., Maraj, M., Measuring mammography and breast cancer beliefs in African American women (2008) Journal of Health Psychology, 13 (6), pp. 827-837; Cucinotta, D., Vanelli, M., WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic (2020) Acta Bio-Medica: Atenei Parmensis, 91 (1), pp. 157-160; Devellis, R.F., (2016) Scale Development: Theory and Applications, , 4th ed.).

This is the case in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. Given the heightened fear concerning COVID-19 in Italy., the present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Methods: The sample comprised 250 Italian participants who were administered Italian versions of the FCV-19S, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Severity Measure for Specific Phobia–Adult (SMSP-A). Several psychometric tests were performed to investigate the validity and reliability of the test including confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Analysis of the data showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics and confirmed the scale’s unidimensional properties. The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from.443 to.784). Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from.684 to.897). The internal consistency was very good (α =.871). Construct validity for the FCV-19S was supported by significant and positive correlations with the HADS (r=.649) and SMSP-A (r=.703). Conclusions: The Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is valid and reliable in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general Italian population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19;

Athens, Greece","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods: A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. Interpretation: Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Health care workers; Insomnia; Mental health",,,,,,,,,"Albert, P.R., Why is depression more prevalent in women?

In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion: This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s)","Aerobic capacity; COVID-19; Immune system; Respiratory system","C reactive protein; immunoglobulin; aerobic capacity; anxiety disorder; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; elasticity; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; incidence; lung parenchyma; priority journal; respiratory function; strength; systematic review",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4",,,,,,"Singhal, T., A review of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Indian J Pediatr, p. 2019; World Health Organization.

However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women. Study design: An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires. Results: Among the respondents, 35.4% (n = 92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369 ± 2.003, social isolation: 8.000 ± 2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565 ± 6.605 and 22.087 ± 8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease’s psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness’s social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants. Conclusion: This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; pandemic; pregnancy","adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; educational status; female; human; major clinical study; pandemic; pregnancy; priority journal; psychology; risk factor; social isolation",,,,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; Nishiura, J., Linton, K., Yang, H., The extent of transmission of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020 (2020) JCM, 9 (2), p. 330; Mahase, E., China coronavirus: WHO declares international emergency as death toll exceeds 200 (2020) BMJ, 368, p. m408; Cucinotta, D., Vanelli, M., WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic (2020) Acta Biomed, 91 (1), pp. 157-160; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Zhao, M., Lin, R., Yang, W., Estimating the unreported number of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases in china in the first half of January 2020: a data-driven modelling analysis of the early outbreak (2020) JCM, 9 (2), p. 388; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513; Stockman, L.J., Lowther, S.A., Coy, K., SARS during pregnancy, United States (2004) Emerging Infect Dis, 10 (9), pp. 1689-1690; Dashraath, P., Jing Lin Jeslyn, W., Mei Xian Karen, L., Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and pregnancy (2020) Am J Obstet Gynecol, , In Press; Wang, C., Pan, R., Wan, X., Immediate psychological responses and associated factors during the initial stage of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic among the general population in China (2020) IJERPH, 17 (5), p. 1729; Li, Z., Ge, J., Yang, M., Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control (2020) Brain Behav Immun; Cox, J.L., Holden, J.M., Sagovsky, R., Detection of postnatal depression.

Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Methods: Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Results: Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. Conclusion: For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary. © 2020 Diabetes India","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Internet; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychosocial; Quarantine; SARS-CoV2; Social media; Stigma; Telemedicine","adverse outcome; anxiety; Article; burnout; caregiver; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; drug dependence; health care personnel; hoarding; human; infection; lifestyle; mental patient; obsession; pandemic; panic; paranoia; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; psychosocial care; quarantine; racism; severe acute respiratory syndrome; social isolation; social media; social support; stigma; xenophobia",,,,,,,,"Jones, D.S., History in a crisis - lessons for covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med; Lai, C.C., Shih, T.P., Ko, W.C., Tang, H.J., Hsueh, P.R., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): the epidemic and the challenges (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, 55, p. 105924; Rubin, G.J., Wessely, S., The psychological effects of quarantining a city (2020) BMJ, 368, p. m313; Pulla, P., Covid-19: India imposes lockdown for 21 days and cases rise (2020) BMJ, 368, p. m1251; Kluge, H.N.P., Statement – physical and mental health key to resilience during COVID-19 pandemic http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/statements/statement-physical-and-mental-health-key-to-resilience-during-covid-19-pandemic, (accessed on 30th March, 2020); Depoux, A., Martin, S., Karafillakis, E., Bsd, R.P., Wilder-Smith, A., Larson, H., The pandemic of social media panic travels faster than the COVID-19 outbreak (2020) J Trav Med, , taaa031; Sim, K., Chua, H.C., The psychological impact of SARS: a matter of heart and mind (2004) CMAJ, 170, pp. 811-812; Wu, P., Fang, Y., Guan, Z., Fan, B., Kong, J., Yao, Z., Liu, X., Hoven, C.W., The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk (2009) Can J Psychiatr, 54, pp. 302-311; Shigemura, J., Ursano, R.J., Morganstein, J.C., Kurosawa, M., Benedek, D.M., Public responses to the novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Japan: mental health consequences and target populations (2020) Psychiatr Clin Neurosci, 74, pp. 281-282; Lima, C.K.T., Carvalho, P.M.M., Lima, I.A.A.S., Nunes, J.V.A.O., Saraiva, J.S., de Souza, R.I., The emotional impact of Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (new Coronavirus disease) (2020) Psychiatr Res, 287, p. 112915; Zandifar, A., Badrfam, R., Iranian mental health during the COVID-19 epidemic (2020) Asian J Psychiatr, 51, p. 101990; Lee, S., Chan, L.Y., Chau, A.M., Kwok, K.P., Kleinman, A., The experience of SARS-related stigma at Amoy Gardens (2005) Soc Sci Med, 61, pp. 2038-2046; Person, B., Sy, F., Holton, K., Govert, B., Liang, A., National center for inectious diseases/SARS community outreach team.

A total of 515 self-isolating people completed the online questionnaire including questions asking for demographic information and the impact of COVID-19 on their (mental and physical) health. The results showed that prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD was 14.4, 29.7, and 5.6%, respectively.

The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results: We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent. © 2020","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health care workers; Stress","adult; anxiety; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; epidemic; female; health care personnel; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; male; mental stress; morbidity; multicenter study; Perceived Stress Scale; prevalence; priority journal; psychological aspect; risk factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; work experience",,,,,,,,"Ahmed, I., Banu, H., Al-Fageer, R., Al-Suwaidi, R., Cognitive emotions: depression and anxiety in medical students and staff (2009) J.

However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged ≥18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02–0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: −0.07, 95% CI: −0.10–−0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10–0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: −0.30, 95% CI: −0.34–−0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated. Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal or cognitive behavioral treatments may be most promising. © 2020 by the authors.

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Public health; Stress","aging; anxiety disorder; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; crisis intervention; depression; disaster planning; empowerment; family separation; fatigue; fear; foreign student; health care access; health care delivery; health care personnel; health economics; homeless person; hospital service; human; infection risk; information seeking; information service; loneliness; maladjustment; medical specialist; mental health; mental health care; mental health service; mental patient; mental stress; migrant worker; misinformation; motivation; panic; patient counseling; pregnant woman; priority journal; problem solving; psychoeducation; psychological well-being; psychosocial care; sleep disorder; social isolation; social stigma; social support; social welfare; systematic review; teleconsultation; telepsychiatry; vulnerable population; working time",,,,,,,,"Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y.-J., Mao, Y.-P., Ye, R.-X., Wang, Q.-Z., Sun, C., Zhou, H., Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review (2020) Infect.

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemic; Longitudinal; Pandemic; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Precaution; Stress",,,,,,,"This work was supported by grants from the Huaibei Normal University (to Cuiyan Wang), Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) COVID research grant (VINIF.2020.Covid19.DA07 to Bach Tran) and National University of Singapore , Singapore iHeathtech Other Operating Expenses (R-722-000-004-731 to Roger Ho).",,"Cao, W., Fang, Z., Hou, G., The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China (2020) Psychiatry Res., 287; Christianson, S., Marren, J., The impact of event scale – revised (IES-R) (2012) Medsurg.

Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction.

We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic. © 2020","Brief psychotic disorder; Brief reactive psychosis; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare professional; Mental health","lorazepam; olanzapine; adult; anxiety disorder; behavior disorder; brief psychotic disorder; case report; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; delusion; disease surveillance; drug indication; DSM-5; emergency ward; family history; female; follow up; functional disease; general practitioner; health care personnel; hospital discharge; human; insomnia; irritability; job stress; Letter; medical history; mental health; neurologic examination; obsessive compulsive disorder; pandemic; physical examination; primary medical care; priority journal; psychopharmacotherapy; psychosis; restlessness; self concept; suicidal ideation",,"lorazepam, 846-49-1; olanzapine, 132539-06-1",,,"Sunovion

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. Methods: An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. Results: More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making were ▪ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment, ▪ risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, and ▪ patient risk of contracting covid-19. Conclusions: This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified. © 2020 Multimed Inc.","CAMO; COVID-19; Medical oncology; Surveys","age; anxiety; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; chemotherapy; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; decision making; depression; health care survey; health care utilization; hopelessness; human; human experiment; medical oncologist; medical society; nervousness; patient care; patient preference; risk factor; social distance; telemedicine; wellbeing; Canada; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; oncologist; oncology; pandemic; protective equipment; psychology; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; Anxiety; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Oncologists; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine",,,,,,,,"(2020) COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), , https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University;, cited 11 April 2020; Guan, W., Ni, Z., Hu, Y., on behalf of the China Medical Treatment Expert Group for covid-19.

Methods: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. Results: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. Conclusion: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Medications; Orthopaedics",,,,,,,,,"Kakodkar, P., Kaka, N., Baig, M.N., A comprehensive literature review on the clinical presentation, and management of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Cureus, 12 (4). , PID: 32269893; Shanthanna, H., Strand, N.H., Provenzano, D.A., Caring for patients with pain during the COVID-19 pandemic: consensus recommendations from an international expert panel (2020) Anaesthesia, , (,),.,., https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15076; Russell, B., Moss, C., Rigg, A., Van Hemelrijck, M., COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?

Patients may develop severe pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and a significant proportion of them dies. It has been suggested that brainstem might play a role in severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. We described three COVID-19 patients in ICU at Federico II Hospital in Naples that, although had recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. Our clinical evaluation was consistent with an involvement of the brainstem and especially of respiratory centre thus possibly explaining the weaning failure in patients that were awake and had recovered from lung involvement. Our data, though limited, indicate that brainstem involvement may play a role in respiratory failure and perhaps in the high death rate of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the weaning failure from mechanical ventilation due to central respiratory drive depression might underlie the unusual long stay in ICU reported for COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia.","brainstem involvement; Covid-19; respiratory failure; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Cao, B., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Kqu7c%3D; Grasselli, G., Zangrillo, A., Zanella, A., Antonelli, M., Cabrini, L., Castelli, A., Cereda, D., Pesenti, A., Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region (2020) Italy JAMA, 323, p. 1574; Tassorelli, C., Mojoli, F., Baldanti, F., Bruno, R., Benazzo, M., COVID-19: What if the brain had a role in causing the deaths?

It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms. Results: The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001). Conclusions: The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions. © Copyright © 2020 Zhu, Sun, Zhang, Wang, Fan, Yang, Li and Xiao.","anxiety; Chinese; COVID-19; depression; medical staff","adult; anxiety assessment; anxiety disorder; Article; China; coping behavior; coping behavior assesment; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; depression; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; nurse attitude; physician attitude; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire; Zung Self Rating Anxiety Scale; Zung Self Rating Depression Scale",,,,,"YG2019QNA10

Global health systems are facing the unprecedented challenges. Here we shared the experiences and lessons in emergency responses and management from our hospital, a government-assigned regional anti-Covid-19 general hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Methods: Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail. An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established. Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out. Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced. Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed. Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced. Findings: Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found. During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy. Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered. Interpretation: As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission. Experience shared herein may be useful for those facilities that are and may encounter Covid-19. © 2020, The Author(s).","Covid-19; Emergency response; Hospital management; Infection prevention and control","anxiety; Article; attitude to illness; China; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; emergency health service; epidemic; health disparity; healthcare associated infection; hospital cost; hospitalization; human; medical education; medical research; medical technology; outpatient care; outpatient department; patient care; patient education; personal experience; priority journal; response variable; surgical approach; virus transmission; ward; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; general hospital; hospital emergency service; hospital management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; workflow; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Service, Hospital; Hospital Administration; Hospitals, General; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Workflow",,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXjslGmsrc%3D; Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: Classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 Nat Microbiol, 2020. , Epub ahead of print; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation report—59, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200319-sitrep-59-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c3dcdef9_2, Accessed 20 March 2020; Organization, W.H., (2004) Laboratory Biosafety Manual, , https://www.who.int/medical_devices/publications/lab_biosafety_manual/en/, Accessed Jan 16 2020; Seto, W.H., Tsang, D., Yung, R.W., Effectiveness of precautions against droplets and contact in prevention of nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (2003) Lancet, 361, pp. 1519-1520. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD3s3islGitQ%3D%3D; Chow, T.T., Kwan, A., Lin, Z., Bai, W., Conversion of operating theatre from positive to negative pressure environment (2006) J Hosp Infect, 64, pp. 371-378. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD28nmtFantw%3D%3D; Zhang, W., Du, R.H., Li, B., Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9, pp. 386-389. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXmsVGltbk%3D; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, , China.

Methods A literature search of PubMed was performed using the terms COVID-19, stress, mental health, healthcare worker, staff, psychiatry. Quantitative studies (including letters to the editor) published from January to March 2020 were included. Results 14 studies on healthcare workers in departments of infectiology, internal medicine, and fever wards including intensive care wards as well as surgery and psychiatry, were included. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9), Self-rating-Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) were the most often used test instruments. The sample size ranged between 37 and 1257 participants consisting of mostly nursing and medical personnel. The fraction of COVID-19-Associated activities varied from 7.5â Š% to 100â Š%. An extensive strain was reported due to stress experience as well as depression and anxiety symptoms. Severe degrees of those symptoms were found in 2.2â Š% to 14.5â Š% of all participants. The severity of mental symptoms was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19 patients. As mediator variables selection of personnel, preventive interventions, resilience, and social support were reported. Conclusion Considering the frequency of mental symptoms occurring in healthcare workers, accompanying mental health informed interventions to facilitate coping are necessary. Further research in this field is needed. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Material and Methods: Cross sectional online survey. Necessary data have been collected from the responses of questionnaires and the questionnaires have been developed utilizing Google form. The study covered 50 participants from various countries from the author's network. We considered a systematic flow diagram from March 25 to March 31, 2020 including demographic information of participants. Results: Al-most 74% of the participants clearly describe and explain all the ques-tions and still, 26% of the participants are not clear about their idea regarding COVID-19 disease. Moreover, the perceptions provided by the participants are also close to the guidelines of WHO and National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China regarding COVID-19. Only few participants’ understandings are not fully com-pleted compared to their guidelines. The current mental status was also analyzed in this study wherein 51% participants stated that they are suffering from mental stress and depression due to this virus. Conclusion: It is necessary to identify and improve the actual knowledge, aware-ness, and perception to control the spread of COVID-19. More awareness activities from responsible authority are required. Moreover, this survey will facilitate healthcare organizations and responsible authority to design their awareness activities in this critical moment. Additionally, general people will get benefited and prepared themselves to read the perceptions of the individual participator. © 2020 by Türkiye Klinikleri.","COVID-19; Cross-sectional studies; Depression; Outcome assessment, health care; Surveys and questionnaires",,,,,,,,,"Yin, Y, Wunderink, RG., MERS, SARS and other coronaviruses as causes of pneumonia (2018) Respirology, 23 (2), pp. 130-137. , [Crossref] [PubMed] [PMC]; Li, Q, Guan, X, Wu, P, Wang, X, Zhou, L, Tong, Y, Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus–infected pneu-monia (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (13), pp. 1199-1207. , [PubMed]; Bhagavathula, AS, Aldhaleei, WA, Rahmani, J, Mahabadi, MA, Bandari, DK., Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) knowledge and perceptions: a survey on healthcare workers (2020) medRxiv, , Jan 1.

However, most studies only have focused on clinical data. Evidence Acquisition: In this short review, the psychological effects of COVID-19 and its association with anxiety were examined. Accordingly, the electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, and Science Direct were reviewed for relevant studies that have conducted since 2007. Results: The current study was carried out to indicate that COVID-19 has negative psychological problems other than mortality. A review of the studies performed in other parts of the world showed that COVID-19 has caused several psychological impacts, including increased anxiety. Conclusions: By an increase in the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and its resulted restrictions, the level of anxiety increases, as well; therefore, raising public awareness of the disease and providing positive psychological programs in the media aimed at controlling stress can reduce anxiety in society. © 2020, Author(s).","Anxiety; COVID-19; Infectious Diseases; Outbreak; Psychological","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; distress syndrome; epidemic; human; mental health; mental health recovery; mental stress; mortality; obsessive compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; quarantine; Review; social avoidance behavior",,,,,,,,"Al-Hazmi, A., Challenges presented by MERS corona virus, and SARS corona virus to global health (2016) Saudi J Biol Sci, 23 (4), pp. 507-511. , [PubMed: 27298584].

METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","college students; COVID-19; health education; mental health","adolescent; alternative medicine; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; depression; female; health status; human; male; pandemic; psychology; questionnaire; student; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Healing; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,16734254,,,"32376528","Chinese","Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084379575

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods: The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score ≥ 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. Ethics and dissemination: The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Mental health; RCT; Scleroderma; Systemic sclerosis; Trial","anxiety; Article; boredom; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; health program; human; intervention study; loneliness; major clinical study; mental health; outcome assessment; physical activity; pragmatic trial; quarantine; randomized controlled trial; risk benefit analysis; scleroderma; social interaction; stress; videoconferencing; vulnerable population",,,,,"McGill University Health Centre, MUHC

Methods: An online survey was completed by ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees during the lockdown. The information collected included demographics (age, gender), domicile (state, union territory), current professional status (in training or practising), type of practice (solo, group, institutional, governmental, non-governmental), marital status (married, single), impact of COVID-19 on their training or practice, and impact on income and ability to meet living expenses. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: In all, 2,355 ophthalmologists responded. Mean age was 42.5 (range, 25-82 years; SD, 12.05) years. Of these, 1,332 (56.7%) were males; 475 (20.2%) were still not in practice; 366 (15.5%) were single; 1,244 (52.8%) felt that COVID-19 would impact on their training or professional work; and 869 (37%) had difficulty in meeting their living expenses. The mean PHQ-9 score was 3.98 (range, 0-27; SD, 4.65). In terms of psychological impact, 768 (32.6%) had some degree of depression; mild in 504 (21.4%), moderate in 163 (6.9%), and severe in 101 (4.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that depression was significantly higher at younger age. The odds of depression decreased by 3% with 1 year increase in age. It was higher in non-practicing ophthalmologists, especially those who were considerably worried about their training or professional growth, and those with difficulty in meeting living expenses. Conclusion: A strikingly high proportion of ophthalmologists are psychologically affected and may require personalized mental health care. © 2020 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; India; ophthalmologists; SARS COV-2","adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; depression; education; female; health survey; human; India; male; medical education; medical student; mental stress; middle aged; ophthalmologist; ophthalmology; pandemic; psychology; risk factor; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; India; Internship and Residency; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmologists; Ophthalmology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical",,,,,,"We would like to acknowledge the support from All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) President, Dr Mahipal S Sachdev and Honorary General Secretary, Prof Namrata Sharma for their assistance in conducting this survey.

Half of the worldh as been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management. © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health personnel; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder",,,,,,,,,"Brooks, S.K., Webster, R.K., Smith, L.E., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence (2020) Lancet, 395 (10227), pp. 912-920; Koh, D., Lim, M.K., Chia, S.E., Risk perception and impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on work and personal lives of healthcare workers in Singapore: what can we learn?

Efforts to prevent the virus from spreading include travel restrictions, lockdowns as well as national or regional quarantines throughout the international community. The major negative psychological outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is the anxiety caused by it. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of concern and the contributions of modes of resilience, well-being and demographic attributes towards decreasing or enhancing anxiety and depression among two samples: Israeli Jews (majority group) and Israeli Arabs (minority group). These random samples included 605 Jews and 156 Arabs who participated in an internet survey. A previous study, which has been conducted in the context of terror attacks, has shown that compared to Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs expressed a higher level of fear of war and lower levels of resilience supporting personality attributes. The results of the current study indicated a similar pattern that emerged in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: the Israeli Arabs reported a higher level of distress and a lower level of resilience and well-being. © 2020 by the authors.

The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone. © 2020 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Grief; Mindfulness; Pandemic; Physician wellness; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing; Wellness","ambulatory care; anxiety; burnout; coping behavior; Coronavirus infection; depression; drug dependence; grief; guilt; health care delivery; health care organization; health promotion; health status; human; immunology; interpersonal communication; mental health; mindfulness; pandemic; physician; posttraumatic stress disorder; productivity; professionalism; psychology; religion; social behavior; social media; suicide; virus pneumonia; Adaptation, Psychological; Allergy and Immunology; Ambulatory Care; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Depression; Efficiency; Grief; Guilt; Health Care Rationing; Health Promotion; Health Status; Humans; Mental Health; Mindfulness; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; Social Behavior; Social Media; Spirituality; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide",,,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ: 5K08HS024599-02

Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students’ mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality (β = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness (β = −6.57, 95% CI: −12.78, −0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p < 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions (β = −0.12, 95% CI: −0.22, −0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well. (c) The COVID-19 outbreak has reduced people’s aggressiveness, probably by making people realize the fragility and preciousness of life. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: 600 valid questionnaires were received. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used. Results: Females’ anxiety risk was 3.01 times compared to males (95% CI 1.39–6.52). Compared with people below 40 years old, the anxiety risk of people above 40 years old was 0.40 times (95% CI 0.16–0.99). SDS results indicated that the difference between education level and occupation was statistically significant (p = 0.024, 0.005). Compared to people with a master’s degree or above, those with a bachelor’s degree group had a depression risk of 0.39 times (95% CI 0.17–0.87). Compared with professionals, industrial service workers and other staff had a depression risk of 0.31 times (95% CI 0.15–0.65) and 0.38 times (95% CI 0.15–0.93). Conclusions: 600 questionnaire participants were psychologically stable. Non-anxiety and non-depression rates were 93.67% and 82.83%, respectively. There were anxiety in 6.33% and depression in 17.17%. Therefore, we should pay attention to the psychological states of the public. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; public psychological states; related factors",,,,,,,,,"Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study[J] (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7; Craske, M.G., Stein, M.B., Anxiety (2016) Lancet, 388 (10063), pp. 3048-3059. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30381-6, December, 17, Epub 2016 Jun 24; Drury, J., Carter, H., Cocking, C., Ntontis, E., Tekin Guven, S., Amlôt, R., (2019) Facilitating collective psychosocial resilience in the public in emergencies: Twelve recommendations based on the social identity approach, , https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00141, Front.

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12–18 years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students’ awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Prevalence",,,,,,"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission: Z171100001017001

COVID-19 is characterised by fever and severe acute respiratory symptoms in early stages, which can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome that is associated with high mortality. As of 9 February 2020, 40171 cases have been confirmed cumulatively and 23589 suspected cases were collected in China. The wide and rapid spread of COVID-19 has intensely captured public attention, leading to increased mental health stress. Timely mental health care and intervention during the outbreak of COVID-19 is urgently needed not only for confirmed or suspected patients and frontline medical workers, but also for the general public. Previous studies showed that affirmation of personal values can buffer psychological stress responses in various threat situations. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether an intervention involving reflection on personal values was capable of buffering psychological stress responses during the outbreak. We recruited 220 participants who completed a questionnaire on their personal values. Those in the self-affirmation group were asked to choose and write their thoughts and feelings of a personal value that made them feel important to themselves while those in the control condition were asked to do the same for a personal value that they thought was important to others. Both groups completed a Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) prior to and 7 days after intervention. We used two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the buffer effect of value affirmation on stress responses with time of assessment as a within-subjects factor and intervention group as a between-subjects factor for anxiety and depression. Our results revealed a significant relationship between time and intervention for the reduction of anxiety. Further simple effect analysis demonstrated that the control group showed heightened levels of anxiety 7 days after intervention compared with before, whereas participants who affirmed their values did not show any increase. This effect remained significant after controlling for sex, age, educational level, and annual family income. However, no significant differences were found for depression. The present study demonstrates for the first time that an experimental intervention involving the affirmation of personal values can buffer psychological stress response during the COVID-19 epidemic. Specifically, participants who affirmed their values did not show increased levels of anxiety compared with control participants. Self-affirmation is easy to accomplish since it does not require professional guidance or a distinct environment and occupies little time, it would be a convenient strategy for the public to cope with psychological stress during the outbreak. © 2020, Science Press.

The outbreak of COVID-19 was unique in its rapidity of transmission, which has become a global health emergency within just a few months in all countries worldwide. This disease will not only raise public health concerns but also cause several psychological distress, including anxiety, fear, depression, stigmatization, avoidance behaviors, irritability, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this situation, the maintenance of mental health status of individuals is very important because people in different parts of society may experience additional stressors during the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals in different parts of a society may experience the psychological symptoms to COVID-19 during the rising phase of the outbreak, including patients of COVID-19, quarantine individuals, health care workers and family members of medical staffs, children, university students, pregnant women, and families. In this regard, there is the strong evidence that the mental health status of these populations is vulnerable to exhibition of the psychological disorders symptoms. © 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemic; Immunopsychiatry; Insomnia; Lockdown; Pandemic; Psychiatric illness; PTSD; Stress; Suicide",,,,,,"cstc2019kpzx-kphdA0014","This work was supported by grants from the Chongqing Science and Technology Dissemination and Popularization Project (cstc2019kpzx-kphdA0014) for Fengyi Hao, Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) COVID research grant ( VINIF.2020.Covid19.DA07 ) for Bach Tran and National University of Singapore iHeathtech Other Operating Expenses ( R-722-000-004-731 ) for Roger Ho.",,"Bastien, C.H., Vallières, A., Morin, C.M., Validation of the Insomnia Severity Index as an outcome measure for insomnia research (2001) Sleep Med., 2 (4), pp. 297-307; Chew, N., Lee, L.G., Tan, B.Y., Jing, M., Goh, Y., Ngiam, N., Yeo, L., Sharma, V., A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak (2020) Brain Behav.

Methods: An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results: Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the factors which need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental wellbeing of doctors while fighting with a disaster that has major impacts on society worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Doctors; Healthcare workers; Outbreak; Psychological effects","adult; age; anxiety; Article; attitude to illness; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; family life; female; gender; health survey; human; male; online system; pandemic; physician attitude; priority journal; professional competence; stress; support group; symptom; work environment; work experience; working time",,,,,,,,"Bai, Y., Lin, C.-C., Lin, C.-Y., Chen, J.-Y., Chue, C.-M., Chou, P., Survey of stress reactions among health care workers involved with the SARS outbreak (2004) Psychiatr.

Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Conspiracy theories; COVID-19; Depression; Lockdonw; Mental health; Quarantine; Suicidality; University students","adult; anonymised data; anxiety; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; female; Greece; human; human experiment; isolation; Letter; male; mental health; online system; priority journal; quality of life; quarantine; scoring system; sexual behavior; sleep quality; sleep time; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; university student; young adult",,,,,,,,"Cao, W., Fang, Z., Hou, G., Han, M., Xu, X., Dong, J., Zheng, J., The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China (2020) Psychiatry Res., 287; Fountoulakis, K., Iacovides, A., Kleanthous, S., Samolis, S., Kaprinis, S.G., Sitzoglou, K., Kaprinis, S., G., B., Reliability, validity and psychometric properties of the Greek translation of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale (2001) BMC Psychiatry, 1, p. 3; Fountoulakis, K.N., Pantoula, E., Siamouli, M., Moutou, K., Gonda, X., Rihmer, Z., Iacovides, A., Akiskal, H., Development of the Risk Assessment Suicidality Scale (RASS): a population-based study (2012) J.

Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods: We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results: A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. Conclusion: Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Mental health; Mental health disorders; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"Lundbeckfonden: R268-2016-3925","The present study was funded by an unrestricted grant from The Lundbeck Foundation , Denmark (grant number R268-2016-3925 ).",,"Asadi-Pooya, A.A., Simani, L., Central nervous system manifestations of COVID-19: a systematic review (2020) J.

This is a longitudinal study on changes in the mental health status of a college population before and after their COVID-19 confinement for the first two weeks, focusing on states of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and affectivity. The influence of possible stressors on their mental health were investigated, including inadequate supplies and fears of infection. Five hundred and fifty-five undergraduate students were recruited from Hebei Agricultural University in Baoding, China. The participants completed two online surveys—on anxiety and depression, and on positive and negative affect. One survey was conducted before the confinement and the other was conducted 15–17 days after the start of the confinement. Increases in negative affect and symptoms of anxiety and depression (p-values < 0.001) were observed after 2 weeks of confinement. Inadequate supplies of hand sanitizers, a higher year of study, and higher scores on anxiety and depression were common predictors of increased negative affect, anxiety, and depression across the confinement period. The results suggest that healthcare policymakers should carefully consider the appropriate confinement duration, and ensure adequate supplies of basic infection-control materials. © 2020 by the authors.

Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Depression; Insomnia; Occupational health mental health; Pandemic; PTSD; Quarantine; Stress; Suicide; Workers; Workforce",,,,,,"cstc2019kpzx-kphdA0014","This work was supported by grants from the Chongqing Science and Technology Dissemination and Popularization Project (cstc2019kpzx-kphdA0014) for Fengyi Hao, Vingroup Innovation Foundation (VINIF) COVID research grant (VINIF.2020.Covid19.DA07) for Bach Tran and National University of Singapore iHeathtech Other Operating Expenses ( R-722-000-004-731 ) for Roger Ho.",,"Bastien, C.H., Vallières, A., Morin, C.M., Validation of the Insomnia Severity Index as an outcome measure for insomnia research (2001) Sleep Med., 2, pp. 297-307; Chan, A.O., Huak, C.Y., Psychological impact of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak on health care workers in a medium size regional general hospital in Singapore (2004) Occup Med (Lond), 54, pp. 190-196; CHRYSOLORAS, N., Here's Europe's Plan to Get People Back to Work After Covid-19 [Online] (2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/here-s-europe-s-plan-to-get-people-back-to-work-after-covid-19, Bloomberg.

Subjects and methods: In this study, content validity, Cronbach’s alpha, and test–retest reliability method were utilized among 60 HCWs to evaluate the validity, internal consistency, and reliability of the questionnaire respectively. The final questionnaire was composed of four parts asking for the background information, questions about the stress caused by the COVID-19, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), and six questions from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Results: The CVR of 46 questions was equal to 1, making them acceptably valid (CVR > 0.78), so that the items could be arranged into a final questionnaire. Moreover, all items could successfully attain CVI values above 0.79, confirming the content validity of the questionnaire. The Cronbach’s alpha was between 0.80–0.95 for different sections of questionaire, confirming the stable reliability and high repeatability of the questionnaire. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the DASS-21 offers adequate levels of validity and reliability for assessing the stress, anxiety, and depression among the HCWs engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the six items adapted from the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) were found to provide a good instrument for investigating the job burnout among the HCWs at Masih Daneshvari Hospital during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Burn out; COVID-19; DASS 21; Healthcare workers; Stress",,,,,,,,,"Al-Rabiaah, A., Middle East respiratory syndrome–corona virus (MERS-CoV) associated stress among medical students at a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia (2020) J Infect Public Health, 13 (5), pp. 687-691; Almutairi, A.F., Adlan, A.A., Balkhy, H.H., Abbas, O.A., Clark, A.M., It feels like I’m the dirtiest person in the world.”: exploring the experiences of healthcare providers who survived MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (2018) J Infect Public Health, 11, pp. 187-191; Bakker, A.B., Le Blanc, P.M., Schaufeli, W.B., Burnout contagion among intensive care nurses (2005) J Advanced Nursing, 51, pp. 276-287; Cook, D.A., Beckman, T.J., Current concepts in validity and reliability for psychometric instruments: theory and application the (2006) Am J Med, 119, pp. 166.e7-166.e16; DeVon, H.A., A psychometric toolbox for testing validity and reliability (2007) J Nurs Scholarsh, 39, pp. 155-164; Drost, E.A., Validity and reliability in social science research (2011) Educ Res Perspect, 38, p. 105; Dyrbye, L.N., Shanafelt, T.D., Johnson, P.O., Johnson, L.A., Satele, D., West, C.P., A cross-sectional study exploring the relationship between burnout, absenteeism, and job performance among American nurses (2019) BMC Nurs, 18, p. 57; Elshaer, N.S.M., Moustafa, M.S.A., Aiad, M.W., Ramadan, M.I.E., Job stress and burnout syndrome among critical care healthcare workers (2018) Alexandria J Med, 54, pp. 273-277; Embriaco, N., Papazian, L., Kentish-Barnes, N., Pochard, F., Azoulay, E., Burnout syndrome among critical care healthcare workers (2007) Curr Opin Crit Care, 13, pp. 482-488; Estryn-Behar, M., Van Der Heijden, B., Camerino, D., Fry, C., Le Nezet, O., Conway, P.M., Hasselhorn, H.-M., Violence risks in nursing—results from the European ‘NEXT’Study (2008) Occup Med, 58, pp. 107-114; Goldberg, R., Burnout and its correlates in emergency physicians: four years' experience with a wellness booth (1996) Acad Emerg Med, 3, pp. 1156-1164. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2s7hvVaqsg%3D%3D; Hong, X., Currier, G.W., Zhao, X., Jiang, Y., Zhou, W., Wei, J., Posttraumatic stress disorder in convalescent severe acute respiratory syndrome patients: a 4-year follow-up study (2009) Gen Hosp Psychiatry, 31, pp. 546-554; Huang, C., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Kqu7c%3D; Kim, J.S., Choi, J.S., Factors influencing emergency nurses' burnout during an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Korea (2016) Asian Nursing Res, 10, pp. 295-299; Lancee, W.J., Maunder, R.G., Goldbloom, D.S., Prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Toronto hospital workers 1 to 2 years after the SARS outbreak (2008) Psychiatr Serv, 59, pp. 91-95; Lawshe, C.H., A quantitative approach to content validity (1975) Pers Psychol, 28, pp. 563-575; Lovibond, P.F., Lovibond, S.H., The structure of negative emotional states: comparison of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) with the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories (1995) Behav Res Ther, 33, pp. 335-343. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2M3ktl2jsA%3D%3D; Maunder, R.G., Long-term psychological and occupational effects of providing hospital healthcare during SARS outbreak (2006) Emerg Infect Dis, 12, p. 1924; Memish, Z., Screening for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in hospital patients and their healthcare worker and family contacts: a prospective descriptive study (2014) Clin Microbiol Infect, 20, pp. 469-474. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXptVahsL8%3D; Mobaraki, K., Ahmadzadeh, J., Current epidemiological status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in the world from 1.1. 2017 to 17.1. 2018: a cross-sectional study (2019) BMC Infect Dis, 19, p. 351; Oboho, I.K., 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah—a link to health care facilities (2015) N Engl J Med, 372, pp. 846-854. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXkt1WqtLk%3D; (2003) Consensus Document on the Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use. © 2020 by the authors.

We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Younger people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Mental health; Sleep","adult; age distribution; Article; Chinese; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; depression; epidemic; female; generalized anxiety disorder; health care personnel; human; Internet; male; prevalence; priority journal; sex ratio; sleep quality; aged; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; depression; insomnia; mental health; middle aged; pandemic; psychology; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China .

We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods: Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results: Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Pandemic; Physical symptoms; Psychological impact; Stress",,,,,,"National Medical Research Council, NMRC","VKS is the current recipient of Senior Clinician Scientist Award from National Medical Research Council, Ministry of Health, Singapore.

This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. Method: The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. Results: The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Conclusions: The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Sleep duration; Undergraduate","adolescent; adult; Article; China; Chinese; college student; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; epidemic; fear; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; mental patient; patient health questionnaire; posttraumatic stress disorder; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; quarantine; risk factor; sleep time; undergraduate student; university student; young adult",,,,,"CSXL-151203

Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used. Results: One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey. Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 ≥ 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs. 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.041). Moreover, PHQ-9 ≥ 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 ± 4.96 vs. 4.88 ± 3.53 and 11.60 ± 5.53 vs. 4.84 ± 3.81, respectively; p&lt;.001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 ± 7.45 vs. 46.01 ± 7.83, p&lt;.001) and physical (43.50 ± 9.37 vs. 52.94 ± 4.78, p&lt;.001) component summary. Conclusions: Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions. A precarious healthcare system both at a national and regional level might have triggered negative mental health outcomes in Italian GPs. © Mattioli 1885.","Covid-19; General practitioners; Italy; Mental health","adult; anxiety; Article; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; female; general practitioner; Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 7; health survey; helplessness; human; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; Likert scale; male; Mental Component Summary 12; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; Physical Component Summary 12; quality of life; questionnaire; scoring system; self report; Short Form 12; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Internet; Italy; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,"2018-2022","This work was developed within the framework of the DINOGMI Department of Excellence of MIUR 2018-2022 (Law 232/2016).",,"https://www.who.int; Odone, A., Landriscina, T., Amerio, A., The impact of the current economic crisis on mental health in Italy: Evidence from two representative national surveys (2018) Eur J Public Health, 28 (3), pp. 490-495; http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it; https://portale.fnomceo.it; Fiorino, G., Colombo, M., Natale, C., Clinician Education and Adoption of Preventive Measures for COVID-19: A Survey of a Convenience Sample of General Practitioners in Lombardy, Italy (2020) Ann Intern Med, , Online ahead of print; Li, D., Zhu, S., Contributions and challenges of general practitioners in China fighting against the novel coronavirus crisis (2020) Fam Med Community Health, 8 (2); Shanafelt, T., Ripp, J., Trockel, M., Understanding and Addressing Sources of Anxiety Among Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) JAMA, , Online ahead of print; Rimmer, A., Covid-19: GPs call for same personal protective equipment as hospital doctors (2020) BMJ, 368; Spitzer, R., Kroken, K., Williams, J.B., Validation and Utility of a Self-Report Version of PRIME-MD: The PHQ Primary Care Study.

España","OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disease forced different countries to adopt quarantine measures. These actions could have an impact on mental health in the general population. The objective of this study was to analyze the differences in psychopathological symptoms shown by Spanish general population during the COVID-19 quarantine based on sociodemographic, occupational and environmental-contextual variables. METHODS: A cross-sectional pilot study was performed in a sample of 151 participants aged between 18-76 years old. The Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire via online was used to measure the severity of psychopathology symptoms. Socio-demographic, environmental and occupational variables were collected with an ad hoc questionnaire. The data were gathered from the 3rd to the 6th of April, 2020. A descriptive and comparative analysis was carried out using parametric contrasts (t test and ANOVA). RESULTS: The younger participants (18-35 years) showed higher levels of hostility (t=2.24; p=0.02), depression (t=2.56; p=0.01), anxiety (t=2.78; p=0.006) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=2.08; p=0.04) than older participants (36-76 years). The active or employed people presented lower values of depressive symptoms (t=2.10; p=0.04) than unemployed people. The participants who dedicate less than 30 minutes on getting informed about COVID-19 showed higher scores for hostility (t=2.36; p=0.02) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=1.98; p=0.04) than participants who indicated dedicating at least 30 minutes. People who played sport daily reported a lower level of somatization symptoms (t=-2.11; p=0.03) than persons that did not play sport. Those who had relatives, acquaintances, etc. with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety (t=2.09; p=0.04) than those who did not have close people infected. Lastly, participants who lived alone showed a higher level of psychoticism (F=3.93; p=0.02) compared to those who lived with more than two people. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study show that during quarantine can be identified groups with higher psychological vulnerability based on sociodemographic and occupational-contextual factors.OBJETIVO: La enfermedad pandémica por coronavirus (COVID-19) ha hecho necesaria la adopción de medidas de cuarentena en diferentes países. Estas medidas podrían tener un impacto sobre la salud mental de la población general en confinamiento. El objetivo del trabajo fue analizar las diferencias en la sintomatología psicopatológica mostrada por la población general española durante la cuarentena por COVID-19 en función de variables sociodemográficas, ambientales y ocupacionales. METODOS: Se realizó un estudio trasversal en una muestra de 151 participantes, con edades comprendidas entre los 18 y los 76 años, en el que se utilizó de forma online la versión española del Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire para medir el nivel de síntomas psicopatológicos. Se recogieron también variables sociodemográficas, ambientales y de ocupación (mediante una encuesta ad hoc). La información fue recogida del 3 al 6 abril de 2020. Se realizó un análisis descriptivo y comparativo utilizando contrastes paramétricos (prueba t y ANOVA). RESULTADOS: Los participantes más jóvenes (18-35 años) mostraron niveles más altos de hostilidad (t=2,24; p=0,02), depresión (t=2,56; p=0,01), ansiedad (t=2,78; p=0,006) y sensibilidad interpersonal (t=2,08; p=0,04) que los participantes mayores (36-76 años). Las personas activas o empleadas presentaron valores más bajos de síntomas depresivos (t=2,10; p=0,04) que las personas desempleadas. Los participantes que dedicaron menos de 30 minutos a informarse sobre el COVID-19 mostraron puntuaciones más altas en hostilidad (t=2,36; p=0,02) y sensibilidad interpersonal (t=1,98; p=0,04) que los participantes que indicaron dedicar al menos 30 minutos. Las personas que practicaban deporte diariamente informaron de un menor nivel de síntomas de somatización (t=-2,11; p=0,03) que las personas que no practicaban deporte. Aquellos que tenían familiares, conocidos, etc. con COVID-19 informaron de niveles más altos de ansiedad (t=2,09; p=0,04) que aquellos que no tenían a personas cercanas infectadas. Por último, los participantes que vivían solos mostraron un mayor nivel de psicoticismo (F=3,93; p=0,02) en comparación con aquellos que vivían con más de dos personas. CONCLUSIONES: Los resultados de este estudio muestran que durante la cuarentena se pueden identificar grupos con mayor vulnerabilidad psicológica en función de factores sociodemográficos y ocupacionales-contextuales.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Population; Psychology; Psychopathology; Public health; Quarantine; Spain","adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; depression; human; male; mental disease; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; pandemic; pilot study; psychology; quarantine; questionnaire; Spain; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Spain; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,21739110,,,"32515363","Spanish","Rev.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in spine surgeons in Latin America. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to Latin American spine surgeons from April 4 to 6, 2020. Surgeon characteristics were recorded. The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined. All variables were compared and analyzed. Results: Two hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons. The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12). Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156). Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111). The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario). Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis). Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America. The long-term psychological impact should be taken into consideration to avoid a heavier burden for health care providers. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; depression; Latin America; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; SARS-Cov-2; spine surgeons; spine surgery",,,,,,,,,"(2018) Occupational Safety and Health in Public Health Emergencies: A Manual for Protecting Health Workers and Responders, , World Health Organization; Wu, P., Fang, Y., Guan, Z., The psychological impact of the SARS epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk (2009) Can J Psychiatry, 54, pp. 302-311; Tam, C.W., Pang, E.P., Lam, L.C., Chiu, H.F., Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003: stress and psychological impact among frontline healthcare workers (2004) Psychol Med, 34, pp. 1197-1204; Liu, X., Kakade, M., Fuller, C.J., Depression after exposure to stressful events: lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (2012) Compr Psychiatry, 53, pp. 15-23; Lancee, W.J., Maunder, R.G., Goldbloom, D.S., Coauthors for the Impact of SARS Study.

With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective: To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods: This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results: After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions: Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly. © 2020","Covid-19; Elderly; Psychological state; Pulmonary function; Quality of life; Respiratory rehabilitation","aged; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; complication; controlled study; Coronavirus infection; daily life activity; etiology; female; human; lung function test; male; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; prospective study; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; respiratory care; therapy; virus pneumonia; walking; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Therapy; Walking",,,,,,,,"Wu, Y.C., Chen, C.S., Chan, Y.J., The outbreak of COVID-19: an overview (2020) J.

It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. Key points: Significant findings of the study During the outbreak of COVID-19, taking patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns into consideration, providing appropriate individualized treatment strategies for lung cancer patients with different stages is an urgent requirement. What this study adds Based on the characteristics of lung cancer, this article aims to provide recommendations and suggestions of individualized treatment strategies and management of common adverse events for patients with lung cancer during the epidemic period of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alcohol use disorder; Anxiety; China; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemic","adult; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; anxiety disorder; Article; China; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; depression; disease association; drug dependence; epidemic; female; health status; human; interview; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental health; mental health service; multidisciplinary team; online system; patient counseling; priority journal; psychiatric treatment; psychological well-being; rehabilitation care; self report; vulnerable population",,,,,,,,"Allen, J., Balfour, R., Bell, R., Marmot, M., Social determinants of mental health (2014) Int.

The clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis. If we go into hypoxic hypercapnic state no hyper coagulation takes place.

Current research posits that younger adults without persisting health conditions may be at reduced risk for complications of COVID-19 infection. However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3 × 4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline. © 2020 American Psychological Association.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Gender; Health status",,,,,,,,,,"Alonzi, S.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,19429681,,,,"English","Psychol.

Methods: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. Results: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and ≥75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and ≥£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46). Conclusions: In this sample of UK adults self-isolating/social distancing females, younger age groups, those with a lower annual income, current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental Health; Self-isolation","adult; age distribution; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; female; human; income; isolation; major clinical study; male; mental health; multiple chronic conditions; priority journal; psychological well-being; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,"https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/depression/what-is-depression, American Psychiatric Association.

From the beginning of 2020 it rapidly spread, affecting the whole world, but with a major impact in Europe and North America. At the moment of writing, there are more than 2 million confirmed cases with more than 125.000 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 globally. In Croatia, there are currently 1.741 confirmed cases with 34 deaths related to the virus. The COVID-19 rapid spread and magnitude of pandemic unleashed panic among people which warrants public health officials to also address the epidemic of fear. Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological factors may play a role in coronaphobia. Nov-elty and uncertainty what the unknown brings is likely the cause of COVID-19 fear. With the sharp increase in number of affected persons by pandemic, both infected or suspected cases in isolation, fear and anxiety grew in general population, which warranted a significant increase in need for psychiatric support for both patients and medical staff. After initial stabilization of the situation and a prompt response to increased needs for mental support, during this time of pandemic, self-isolations and imposed social distancing, the strongest earthquake this city has experienced in the last 140 years hit Croatian capital Zagreb. During these trying times, maintaining good mental health of both medical personnel as well as the general population is crucial for both health and mental damage control. In Croatia, crisis interventions aimed for those most exposed to mental impact of pandemic and natural disasters is limited. © 2020 KBCSM, Zagreb.","COVID-19; Crisis intervention; Earthquakes; Mental health; Pandemics","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; Croatia; depression; disease transmission; earthquake; electronic medical record system; epidemic; fear; frustration; health care personnel; human; hypoxia; medical personnel; medical student; mental health; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; pandemic; patient isolation; population density; racism; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social media; stigma; suicidal behavior; World Health Organization",,,,,,,,"Wu, J.T., Leung, K., Leung, G.M., Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and interna-tional spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originat-ing in Wuhan, China: A modelling study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 689-697; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 470-473; (2020) Novel Coronavirus(2019-Ncov): Situation Reports [Internet], , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situ-ation-reports/, [cited April 16, 2020].

A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020. Methods: Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents' behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests. Results: In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities. At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%). Conclusions: We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anxiety; Behavior changes;

METHODS: Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Their clinical baseline data were collected. The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients. RESULTS: Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the isolation treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients, early psychological intervention should be carried out for the female patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area, and drug treatment should be given in advance if necessary.",,"anxiety; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; depression; female; human; isolation and purification; male; pandemic; psychology; risk factor; statistical model; therapy; virus pneumonia; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10089292,,,"32391665","Chinese","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084410812

In this new landscape, it is highly important to acknowledge the challenges this pandemic poses on the care of the particularly vulnerable cancer patients and the subsequent psychosocial impact on them. We have outlined our clinical experience in managing patients with gastrointestinal, hematological, gynaecological, dermatological, neurological, thyroid, lung and paediatric cancers in the COVID-19 era and have reviewed the emerging literature around barriers to care of oncology patients and how this crisis affects them. Moreover, evolving treatment strategies and novel ways of addressing the needs of oncology patients in the new context of the pandemic are discussed. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable “real-time” monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach. © 2020, The Author(s).","Anti-body; Anti-gene; Bottle-neck; Comorbidities; Covid-19; Depression; Economy; Epidemics; Ethics; Home isolation; Individual outcomes; Infection; Laboratory medicine; Multi-professional expertise; Pandemic; Policymaking; Population screening; Predictive preventive personalised (3P) medicine; Psychotic attitude; Related mortality; Salami-tactic; SARS-CoV-2; Strategy; Suicide; Suppressed immune defence; Targeted protective measures; Test; Titanic; Triage; Violence; “Real-time” monitoring","comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease surveillance; economic recession; epidemic; evidence based practice; human; infection prevention; laboratory test; Letter; mortality rate; pandemic; personalized medicine; predictive value; priority journal; Tunisia; virus virulence",,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Zhao, X., Tan, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) New England J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXjslGmsrc%3D; Chih-Cheng, L., Tzu-Ping, S., Wen-Chien, K., Hung-Jen, T., Po-Ren, H., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19): the epidemic and the challenges (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, 55 (3), pp. 1-9; Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Thuan, H.V., Meddeb, L., Sevestre, J., Mailhe, M., Raoult, D., Clinical and microbiological effect of a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 80 COVID-19 patients with at least a six-day follow up: An observational study (2020) Méditerranée Infection., , https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/03/COVID-IHU-2-1.pdf, Accessed March 27 2020; Kim, S.J.S., Shin, D.H., Kim, M.S., Inhibition of sars-cov 3cl protease by flavonoids (2020) J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem, 35 (3), pp. 145-151. , PID: 31724441; (2020) A Study of a Candidate COVID-19 Vaccine (COV001), , https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04324606, U.

Methods: The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results: A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001). Conclusion: FMW have higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-FMW. Further interventions should be administrated for FMW, aiming to maintain their healthy condition and guarantee their professional performance in the battle against COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Medical workers; Pressure; Sleep disturbances","adolescent; anxiety; Article; Athens Insomnia Scale; China; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; disease association; epidemic; female; health care personnel; human; male; mental health; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sleep disorder; sleep disorder assessment; visual analog scale",,,,,"AWS14J011","This study was supported by National Military Science Foundation of China [grant number AWS14J011 ].

And, in much the same way, tourism aficionados, policy makers and communities are asking a similar question—what will the tourism landscape, and indeed the world, look like after the pandemic? As casualties from the crisis continue to fall by the wayside, the rethinking about what an emergent tourism industry might resemble is on in earnest. Many are hopeful that this wake-up call event is an opportunity to reshape tourism into a model that is more sustainable, inclusive and caring of the many stakeholders that rely on it. And some indicators, though not all, point in that direction. In line with this, the concept of ‘human flourishing’ offers merits as an alternative touchstone for evaluating the impacts of tourism on host communities. Human flourishing has a long genesis and its contemporary manifestation, pushed by COVID-19 and applied to travel and tourism, further expands the bounds of its application. Human flourishing has the potential to offer more nuanced sets of approaches by which the impact of tourism on host communities might be measured. The challenge remaining is how to develop robust indices to calibrate human flourishing policy successes. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19; host community; Human flourishing; sustainable tourism indicators; tourism impacts","COVID-19; ecotourism; Great Depression; stakeholder; viral disease",,,,,,,,"Archer, D., (2019), https://destinationthink.com/blog/the-love-of-tourism-bay-of-plenty/, The love of tourism: Bay of plenty plans a future of flourishing,.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional, survey-based, national study evaluating academic otolaryngologists. Burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression were assessed by the single-item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, 15-item Impact of Event Scale, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. Results: A total of 349 physicians completed the survey. Of them, 165 (47.3%) were residents and 212 (60.7%) were males. Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression were reported in 167 (47.9%), 210 (60.2%), 76 (21.8%), and 37 (10.6%) physicians, respectively. Attendings had decreased burnout relative to residents (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, confidence interval [CI] [0.11-0.68]; P =.005). Females had increased burnout (OR 1.93, CI [1.12.-3.32]; P =.018), anxiety (OR 2.53, CI [1.59-4.02]; P <.005), and distress (OR 2.68, CI [1.64-4.37]; P <.005). Physicians in states with greater than 20 000 positive cases had increased distress (OR 2.01, CI [1.22-3.31]; P =.006). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of burnout, anxiety, and distress is high among academic otolaryngologists. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","COVID-19; mental health; mental wellness; otolaryngologists; psychiatric distress",,,,,,,,,"Givi, B., Schiff, B.A., Chinn, S.B., Safety recommendations for evaluation and surgery of the head and neck during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.0780; Vargas, M., Servillo, G., Improving staff safety during tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients (2020) Head Neck, , https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26163; Rassekh, C.H., Jenks, C.M., Ochroch, E.A., Douglas, J.E., O'Malley, B.W., Jr., Weinstein, G.S., Management of the difficult airway in the COVID-19 pandemic: an illustrative complex head and neck case scenario (2020) Head Neck, , https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26175; Tran, K., Cimon, K., Severn, M., Pessoa-Silva, C.L., Conly, J., Aerosol generating procedures and risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections to healthcare workers: a systematic review (2012) PLoS One, 7 (4). , https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035797; (2020), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/europe-s-doctors-getting-sick-like-in-wuhan-chinese-doctors-say, Europe's Doctors Repeat Errors Made in Wuhan, China Medics Say.

Social capital is a measure of social trust, belonging, and participation. This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020 during the COVID-19 epidemic in central China. Methods: Individuals (n=170) who self-isolated at home for 14 days in central China, completed self-reported questionnaires on the third day of isolation. Individual social capital was assessed using the Personal Social Capital Scale 16 (PSCI-16) questionnaire. Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson's correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. Conclusion: During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress. © Med Sci Monit, 2020.","Anxiety; Pneumonia; Sleep","adult; anxiety; China; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; female; human; leisure; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; patient isolation; Personal Social Capital Scale 16 questionnaire; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; quality of life; questionnaire; Review; self care; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep efficiency; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time; social capital; social isolation; Stanford Acute Stress Reaction questionnaire; stress; structural equation modeling; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; depression; physiology; sleep disorder; social support; virus pneumonia; COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Capital; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,"Harbin Engineering University, HEU

Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods: Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results: Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions: Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine","Anxiety; Belongingness; Burdensomeness; COVID-19; Depression; Motivation; Social distancing",,,,,,,"This research was supported by the Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity (CAIRHE) at Montana State University , United States.",,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report – 62 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200322-sitrep-62-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=755c76cd_2, Available at: (Accessed 1 April 2020); Proclamation on declaring a national emergency concerning the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/, Available at: (Accessed 3 April 2020); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report – 74 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_2, Available at: (Accessed 3 April 2020); Oosterhoff, B., Palmer, C., Psychological correlates of news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020); Deci, E.L., Ryan, R.M., Self-determination theory: A macrotheory of human motivation, development, and health (2008) Can Psychol, 49, pp. 182-185; Hardy, S.A., Dollahite, D.C., Johnson, N., Christensen, J.B., Adolescent motivations to engage in pro-social behaviors and abstain from health-risk behaviors: A self-determination theory approach (2015) J Pers, 83, pp. 479-490; Weinstein, N., Ryan, R.M., When helping helps: Autonomous motivation for prosocial behavior and its influence on well-being for the helper and recipient (2010) J Pers Soc Psycol, 98, pp. 222-244; Eisenberg, N., VanSchyndel, S.K., Spinrad, T.L., Prosocial motivation: Inferences from an opaque body of work (2016) Child Dev, 87, pp. 1668-1678; Gebauer, J.E., Riketta, M., Broemer, P., Maio, G.R., Pleasure and pressure based prosocial motivation: Divergent relations to subjective well-being (2008) J Res Pers, 42, pp. 399-420; Lee, F.S., Heimer, H., Giedd, J.N., Adolescent mental health—opportunity and obligation (2014) Science, 346, pp. 547-549; Ahmed, S.P., Bittencourt-Hewitt, A., Sebastian, C.L., Neurocognitive bases of emotion regulation development in adolescence (2015) Dev Cogn Neurosci, 15, pp. 11-25; Spear, L., The behavioral neuroscience of adolescence (2010), WW Norton & Company New York, NY; Furman, W., Buhrmester, D., Children's perceptions of the personal relationships in their social networks (1985) Dev Psychol, 21, pp. 1016-1024; Smetana, J.G., Campione-Barr, N., Metzger, A., Adolescent development in interpersonal and societal contexts (2006) Annu Rev Psychol, 57, pp. 255-284; Joiner, T., Why people die by suicide (2007), Harvard University Press Cambridge, MA; Kessler, R.C., Avenevoli, S., Costello, E.J., Prevalence, persistence, and sociodemographic correlates of DSM-IV disorders in the national Comorbidity survey Replication adolescent supplement (2012) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 69, pp. 372-380; Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science (2015) Science, 349, p. aac4716; Galinsky, E., Ask the children: What America's children really think about working parents (1999), William Morrow and Company, Inc.

Unfortunately, there is no formula or operating manual for how to cope with the current global pandemic. Previous research has documented an array of responses to mass crises or disasters, including chronic anxiety and posttraumatic stress as well as resilience and recovery. Much can be learned from this research about how people have coped in the past in order to identify strategies that may be particularly effective in managing distress and cultivating resilience during these perilous times. We delineate multiple coping strategies (e.g., behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practices) geared to decrease stress and promote resilience and recovery. These strategies may be especially effective because they help individuals make meaning, build distress tolerance, increase social support, foster a view of our deep human interconnectedness, and take goal-directed value-driven actions in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.","Coping; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Loving kindness; Mindfulness; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Stress","adaptation; anxiety; Article; awareness; contact isolation; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; emotionality; human; mindfulness; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological resilience; social support; stress",,,,,,,,"Alloway, T., Runac, R., Qureshi, M., Kemp, G., Is Facebook Linked to Selfishness?

A questionnaire survey was conducted with physical therapists of three university hospitals in South Korea on 10 April 2020. The questionnaires evaluated the presence of anxiety and depression in the respondents. Among the 65 physical therapists who completed our survey, 21 (32.3%) and 12 (18.5%) physical therapists reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. If a physical therapist was living with a ≤6-year-old infant or child, the possibility of the presence of anxiety was significantly higher. The risk of depression among those who were in their 30 s and 50 s was significantly higher than among those in their 20 s. Thus, physical therapists living with a ≤6-year-old infant or child and those in their 30 s and 50 s need special attention. © 2020 by the authors.

Actions are needed to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by protecting and promoting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during and after the outbreak. We developed and evaluated a digital learning package using Agile methodology within the first three weeks of UK outbreak. This e-package includes evidence-based guidance, support and signposting relating to psychological wellbeing for all UK healthcare employees. A three-step rapid development process included public involvement activities (PPIs) (STEP 1), content and technical development with iterative peer review (STEP 2), and delivery and evaluation (STEP 3). The package outlines the actions that team leaders can take to provide psychologically safe spaces for staff, together with guidance on communication and reducing social stigma, peer and family support, signposting others through psychological first aid (PFA), self-care strategies (e.g., rest, work breaks, sleep, shift work, fatigue, healthy lifestyle behaviours), and managing emotions (e.g., moral injury, coping, guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, depression, preventing burnout and psychological trauma). The e-package includes advice from experts in mental wellbeing as well as those with direct pandemic experiences from the frontline, as well as signposting to public mental health guidance. Rapid delivery in STEP 3 was achieved via direct emails through professional networks and social media. Evaluation included assessment of fidelity and implementation qualities. Essential content was identified through PPIs (n = 97) and peer review (n = 10) in STEPS 1 and 2. The most important messages to convey were deemed to be normalisation of psychological responses during a crisis, and encouragement of self-care and help-seeking behaviour. Within 7 days of completion, the package had been accessed 17,633 times, and healthcare providers had confirmed immediate adoption within their health and wellbeing provisions. Evaluation (STEP 3, n = 55) indicated high user satisfaction with content, usability and utility. Assessment of implementation qualities indicated that the package was perceived to be usable, practical, low cost and low burden. Our digital support package on ‘psychological wellbeing for healthcare workers’ is free to use, has been positively evaluated and was highly accessed within one week of release. It is available here: Supplementary Materials. This package was deemed to be appropriate, meaningful and useful for the needs of UK healthcare workers. We recommend provision of this e-package to healthcare workers alongside wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to lockdown, travel restrictions, social and physical distancing requirements or fear that health care facilities may be infected; patients may avoid visiting health care facilities in person. It is also imperative to decrease the risk of exposure of the health care workers (HCWs) to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS CoV2) and to ease the overtly burdened health care system. But any disruption in pain practice will have alarming consequences for individuals, society, and whole of health care system and providers. In the current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine is emerging as a key technology for efficient communication and sustainable solution to provide essential health care services and should be considered for chronic pain patients (CPPs). Recently, Board of Governors in supersession of Medical Council of India along with National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) released 'Telemedicine Practice Guidelines' enabling registered medical practitioners to provide healthcare using telemedicine.

Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain. The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population. An online survey was administered from 18–22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress. © 2020 by the authors.

In this context, the aim of this research was to determine prevalences of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and compassionate fatigue, as well as factors related to the presence of symptoms associated with these disorders in healthcare workers. For this, 126 health professionals from Paraguay were surveyed online, of which 83% were women, with an average age in the total sample of 32 years. The questionnaires PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, ISI-7 for insomnia, IES-R for distress and the module of compassion fatigue of ProQOL - CSF-vIV were applied. It was found that the percentages of participants who reported symptoms classified as moderate and severe were 32.2% for depression, 41.3% for anxiety, 27.8% for insomnia, 38.9% for distress and 64.3% for compassion fatigue. In addition, women and younger people were at greater risk for symptoms. The data provide evidence for the need to establish prevention or intervention strategies to cope with mental health problems in health professionals. © 2020, Sociedad Interamericana de Psicologia.

However, most of these have never been tested under real quarantine situations or derive from older investigations conducted mostly in China and Canada in the face of infections other than COVID–19. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between a comprehensive set of recommended lifestyles, socio– demographic, and personality variables and mood during the first stages of quarantine. Methods: A virtual snow–ball recollection technique was used to disseminate the survey across the general population in Spain starting the first day of mandatory quarantine (15 March 2020) until three days later (17 March). In total, 2683 Spanish adults (mean age = 34.86 years, SD = 13.74 years; 77.7% women) from the general population completed measures on socio–demographic, COVID–related, behavioral, personality/cognitive, and mood characteristics. Results: In the present study, depression and anger were higher than levels reported in a previous investigation before the COVID–19 crisis, while vigor, friendliness, and fatigue were lower. Anxiety levels were comparable. The expected direction of associations was confirmed for the majority of predictors. However, effect sizes were generally small and only a subset of them correlated to most outcomes. Intolerance of unpleasant emotions, neuroticism, and, to a lesser extent, agreeableness, sleep quality, young age, and time spent Internet surfing were the most robust and strongest correlates of mood states. Conclusions: Some recommended lifestyles (i.e., maintaining good quality of sleep and reducing Internet surfing) might be more important than others during the first days of quarantine. Promoting tolerance to unpleasant emotions (e.g., through online, self–managed programs) might also be of upmost importance. So far, recommendations have been made in general, but certain subgroups (e.g., certain personality profiles and young adults) might be especially vulnerable and should receive more attention. © 2020 by the authors.

A previously healthy 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 3 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support. A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction result. Supportive measures, in addition to a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, were maintained until remdesivir could be supplied on day 9 of hospitalization, 13 days after symptom onset. Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation. Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, that are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset. Urgent action is needed by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","coronavirus;

An online-based pilot survey was conducted to study how people with diabetes were coping with their Diabetes during the COVID - 19 lockdown. Method: The questions were designed in an online survey, Survey Monkey, to conduct this cross-sectional study. The link was generated and sent to 100 registered patients of the MV Hospital for Diabetes Royapuram who had not contacted the hospital after the lockdown announcement. The survey was done between April 1 and April 15, 2020.Oral consent was obtained through telephone before the link was sent by Whatsapp to them.The questionnaire consisted of questions on home blood glucose monitoring, regularity in doing their physical activity and dietary compliance and anxiety about the viral infection. Results: 92% of the participants had Type 2 diabetes. Only 28% of the participants were checking their blood glucose levels regularly. 80% of the participants mentioned that they were following regular exercise and diet control during the lockdown period. 40% of the participants were anxious about the Covid infection. Conclusion: SMBG needs to be practiced on regular basis, especially among the patients with diabetes on insulin therapy. Most of the people surveyed were coping well with their Diabetes. Patients have reported that they were able to maintain proper dietary compliance and be more physically active at home during this lockdown.

This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anxiety; COVID-19; Disaster; Media use; Mental health; New media","adult; anxiety; Article; attitude to health; China; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; disease control; disease severity; epidemic; female; human; major clinical study; male; online system; psychological aspect; public health message; social media; stress; virus transmission; web browser",,,,,"TJJX15-002

Literature in this area is sparse. The present study has been done to explore the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of doctors regarding this pandemic and how it influences their depression, anxiety, and stress level. Materials and Methods: This online survey has been done for 10 days. Data were collected on background characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the respondents in a semi-structured pro forma, and psychiatric morbidity was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. A total of 152 complete responses have been received. The data were assessed using SPSS software. Results: Out of 152 study participants, 34.9% were depressed and 39.5% and 32.9% were having anxiety and stress, respectively. Significant predictors for psychiatric morbidities were experience in health sector, duty hours, use of protective measures, and altruistic coping. Multivariable logistic regression showed most of the factors to be significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress level. Discussion: Doctors who were working during COVID pandemic have a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. Age and having multiple comorbidities are significant predictive factors. Adequate protective measures should be warranted. Altruistic coping and a sense of greater goal are significant among the doctor community, in this pressing time. The doctors are pushing themselves to the best of their capacity and also protecting their patients' best interest. A large-scale, multicentric study will probably give a larger picture and will guide us for better service planning and delivery. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Attitude and practice; Comorbidities; COVID-19; Online survey; Stress and depression","hand sanitizer; adult; altruism; anxiety; Article; attitude to health; behavior; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; female; government employee; hand washing; health care practice; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; mental stress; morbidity; observational study; online system; pandemic; physician; self esteem; structured questionnaire; work environment; working time",,,,,,,,"Note from the editors: World Health Organization declares novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sixth public health emergency of international concern (2020) Eurosurveillance, 25, p. 200131e. , Eurosurveillance Editorial Team; https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situationreports/20200324-sitrep-64-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=703b2c40_2, World Health Organization.

Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Ayurveda; COVID-19; Meaning response; Psychoneuroimmunology",,,,,,,,,"Ali, M., Rasayana therapy in classical literature of Ayurveda – a review (1998) Bull.Indian Instit.

Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. METHODS: We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. RESULTS: A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. CONCLUSION: Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self- care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.","coping; COVID-19; infectious disease outbreak; psychosocial responses",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,00375675,,,"32241071","English","Singapore Med J",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083251700

METHODS: We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. RESULTS: The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation. CONCLUSIONS: These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; nursing interns; sleep disturbance","anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; depression; epidemic; pandemic; questionnaire; sleep; virus pneumonia; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,16734254,,,"32376580","Chinese","Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084408851

The social isolation after the lock-down has not only led to economic difficulties but also adverse psychological reactions. The most common reaction is stress, anxiety and depression when faced with life-threatening circumstances. People have to deal with the imminent issue of death which is anxiety provoking in itself. This calls for dealing with the immediate mental health consequences with the aide of technological advancements as discussed in this write-up. A new inter-personal ethics need to emerge which is scientifically correct and in-line with age old values.","COVID-19, Mental Health, Stress, Anxiety, Synchronicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,00309982,,,"32515394","English","J Pak Med Assoc",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086299121

This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL[sbnd]C), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion: These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alexithymia; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Undergraduate",,,,,,"National Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science, NPOPSS: 18BSH121","The authors thank all participants in this study, as well as all the collaborators who helped collect the data.

Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population. © 2020 The Authors",,"adult; age; anxiety; Article; assessment of humans; Australia; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; disease severity; employment; female; financial management; gender; Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment; health care access; health care need; health care personnel; human; hygiene; Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; lifestyle modification; male; mental health; middle aged; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; priority journal; psychological resilience; quarantine; social isolation",,,,,,"MindSpot is funded by the Australian Department of Health.

Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province. Materials and Methods: The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study. Results: A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states. There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The present study implies that universities need to take measures to prevent, identify, and deal with mental health problems among students during large-scale stressors. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Zhu, Fan, Makamure, Zheng and Wang.","anxiety; COVID-19; depression; GAD-7; PHQ-9","adult; anxiety; anxiety assessment; Article; China; college student; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; disease severity; epidemic; female; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Scale; geography; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; mental health; mental stress; online analysis; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prevalence; sex difference; young adult",,,,,"2019CFB639, 2019CFB497

Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including - but not restricted to - child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry. Conclusion: There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adolescents;

The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. Purpose: To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. Results: Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of “burden of taking care of patients” and “worries about social isolation” earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, “worrying about infecting family members and friends” and “worrying about being separated from family after being infected” earned the two highest scores (2.35 ± 0.79 and 2.17 ± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 ± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 ± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 ± 0.92) and depression (1.12 ± 0.94). Nearly twothirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the ‘normal’ range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. “Receiving education and training” was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27 ± 0.51). Conclusions: The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemicprevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses. © 2020, Taiwan Nurses Association.

As a species more fragile than we often allow, humans would be expected to adversely react to these types of disasters in terms of mental ill-health and possibly suicidal behaviour leading to increased demands on the Mental Health services. This narrative historical paper examines relevant studies into how previous disasters affected mental health and suicidal behaviour. The characteristics of what is known of the current Covid-19 disease are analysed and compared to other types of disasters with a view to gaining some insight into what we might expect. Of all the types of disasters, economic recession appears most toxic. Mitigating the worst effects of recession appears to be protective. Particularly vulnerable groups are identified in whom we might expect an increase in suicidal behaviour. © 2020 College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.","covid-19; disaster; economic recession; suicide rate; war",,,,,,,,,"Chang, S.S., Gunnell, D., Sterne, J.A.C., Lu, T.H., Cheng, A.T.A., Was the economic crisis 199701998 responsible for rising suicide rates in East/Southeast Asia A Time-trend Analysis for Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand (2009) Social Science & Medicine, 68, pp. 1322-1331; Cheung, Y.T., Chau, P.H., Psf, Y., A revisit on older adults' suicides and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong (2008) International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 23, pp. 1231-1238; Claassen, C.A., Carmody, T., Stewart, S.M., Bossarte, R.M., Larkin, G.L., Woodward, W.A., Trivedi, M.H., Effect of 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the USA on suicide in areas surrounding the crash sites (2010) British Journal of Psychiatry, 196, pp. 359-364; Corcoran, P., Griffin, E., Arensman, E., Fitzgerald, A.P., Perry, I.J., Impact of the economic recession and subsequent austerity on suicide and self-harm in Ireland: An interrupted time series and analysis (2015) International Journal of Epidemiology., pp. 969-977; Curran, P.S., Curran, P.S., Psychiatric aspects of terrorist violence: Northern Ireland 1969-1987 (1988) British Journal of Psychiatry, 153, pp. 470-475; De Leo, D., San Too, L., Kolves, K., Milner, A., Ide, N., Has the suicide rate risen with the 2011 Queensland Floods (2013) Journal of Loss and Trauma, 18, pp. 170-178; De Lange, A.W., Neeleman, J., The effect of the September 11 terrorist attacks on suicide and deliberate self-harm: A time trend study (2004) Suicide & Life-threatening Behavior, 34 (4), pp. 439-447. , https://doi.org/10.1521/suli.34.4.439.53744; Durkheim, E., (1897) Suicide: A Study in Sociology, , New York: The Free Press; Henderson, R., Stark, C., Humphry, R.W., Selvaraj, S., Changes in Scottish suicide rates during the Second World War (2006) BMC Public Health, 6, p. 167. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-6-167; Kessler, R.C., Galea, S., Al Et.

Although vital, these interventions may be socially and economically disruptive, contributing to adverse psychological outcomes. This study examined relations of both stay-at-home orders and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life to psychological outcomes (depression, health anxiety, financial worry, social support, and loneliness) in a nationwide U.S. community adult sample (N = 500; 47% women, mean age = 40). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological outcomes, stay-at-home order status, and COVID-19’s impact on their daily life. Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness. Moreover, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life was positively associated with health anxiety, financial worry, and social support, but negatively associated with loneliness. Findings highlight the importance of social connection to mitigate negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Health anxiety; Loneliness, Social support","adult; anxiety; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; daily life activity; depression; female; financial deficit; home; human; infection prevention; loneliness; major clinical study; male; pandemic; patient worry; priority journal; psychological aspect; questionnaire; social aspect; social distance; social support; stay at home; United States",,,,,,,,"Abramowitz, J.S., Deacon, B.J., Valentiner, D.P., The Short Health Anxiety Inventory: Psychometric properties and construct validity in a non-clinical sample (2007) Cognit.

Head and neck oncologists are tasked with balancing the dual risks of cancer progression in the setting of impaired tumor immunity and increased susceptibility to life-threatening complications from exposure to viral infection for patients and providers. Through two cases of immunocompromised patients with newly diagnosed head and neck malignancies, we aim to provide guidance to clinicians struggling with how to best counsel and manage this unique subset of patients under these difficult circumstances. Results: After careful consideration of the options, we took different approaches in the care of these two patients. Conclusions: Ultimately, there is no uniform set of rules to apply to this heterogeneous group of immunocompromised patients. We provide some general principles to help guide patient management during the current pandemic. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","airway; COVID-19; head and neck cancer; immunosuppression; risk management","hydroxychloroquine;

This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels, but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress−sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships. © 2020 European Sleep Research Society","COVID-19; home confinement; sleep problems; stress",,,,,,,,,"Akerstedt, T., Kecklund, G., Axelsson, J., Impaired sleep after bedtime stress and worries (2007) Biological Psychology, 76, pp. 170-173; Akerstedt, T., Knutsson, A., Westerholm, P., Theorell, T., Alfredsson, L., Kecklund, G., Sleep disturbances, work stress and work hours: A cross-sectional study (2002) Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 53, pp. 741-748; Altena, E., Micoulaud-Franchi, J.A., Geoffroy, P.A., Sanz-Arigita, E., Bioulac, S., Philip, P., The bidirectional relation between emotional reactivity and sleep: From disruption to recovery (2016) Behavioral Neuroscience, 130, pp. 336-350; Baglioni, C., Altena, E., Bjorvatn, B., Blom, K., Bothelius, K., Devoto, A., Riemann, D., The European Academy for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia: An initiative of the European Insomnia Network to promote implementation and dissemination of treatment (2020) Journal of Sleep Research, 29; Basner, M., Fomberstein, K.M., Razavi, F.M., Banks, S., William, J.H., Rosa, R.R., Dinges, D.F., American time use survey: Sleep time and its relationship to waking activities (2007) Sleep, 30, pp. 1085-1095; Bastien, C.H., Morin, C.M., Ouellet, M.C., Blais, F.C., Bouchard, S., Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia: Comparison of individual therapy, group therapy, and telephone consultations (2004) Journal of Consulting & Clinical Psychology, 72, pp. 653-659; Bittman, M., Wajcman, J., The rush hour: The character of leisure time and gender equity (2000) Social Forces, 79, pp. 165-189; Boullin, P., Ellwood, C., Ellis, J.G., Group vs. individual treatment for acute insomnia: A pilot study evaluating a ""One-Shot"" treatment strategy (2016) Brain Sciences, 7; Brooks, S.K., Webster, R.K., Smith, L.E., Woodland, L., Wessely, S., Greenberg, N., Rubin, G.J., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 912-920; Cortesi, F., Giannotti, F., Sebastiani, T., Vagnoni, C., Marioni, P., Cosleeping versus solitary sleeping in children with bedtime problems: Child emotional problems and parental distress (2008) Behavioral Sleep Medicine, 6, pp. 89-105; Craig, L., Does father care mean fathers share?

Treatment strategies and vaccination for this disease are yet to be explored. Therefore, at this time, the best-proposed health measure to break the chain of transmission is social distancing or, in some instances, quarantine. In a recent systematic review published in Lancet, Brooks et al. (2) evaluated the psychological impacts of quarantine during the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Accordingly, most of the reviewed studies reported adverse psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger (2). Delays in psychological interventions in such situations can lead to psychological damage to individuals who are involved (3). However, people with a pre-existing mental health problem such as anxiety or depressive disorder would be more vulnerable to experience adverse psychological effects of quarantine and social distancing. © 2020 Kowsar Medical Publishing Company.

This COVID-19 epidemic has aroused increasing attention nationwide. Patients, health professionals, and the general public are under insurmountable psychological pressure which may lead to various psychological problems, such as anxiety, fear, depression, and insomnia. Psychological crisis intervention plays a pivotal role in the overall deployment of the disease control. The National Health Commission of China has summoned a call for emergency psychological crisis intervention and thus, various mental health associations and organizations have established expert teams to compile guidelines and public health educational articles/videos for mental health professionals and the general public alongside with online mental health services. In addition, mental health professionals and expert groups are stationed in designated isolation hospitals to provide on-site services. Experts have reached a consensus on the admission of patients with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 outbreak in mental health institutions. Nevertheless, the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 has emerged to mount a serious challenge to the mental health service in China. © The author(s).",,"anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; depression; epidemic; epidemiology; fear; human; insomnia; mental health; mental health service; organization and management; pandemic; practice guideline; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Fear; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",,,,,"Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission

Face-to-face psychotherapy collides with this requirement and, above all, it might endanger both therapists and patients’ safety. Telepsychotherapy might come to the aid, ensuring therapeutic continuity and the possibility to reach people who might benefit of extra psychological support. Infectious outbreaks have been indeed associated with major psychopathological outcomes. The aim of the present work is to review the most recent experimental evidence about telepsychotherapy, focusing on its effectiveness, possible determinants of efficacy and therapists/patients’ attitudes, to rapidly inform psychotherapists. Out of the 857 records found, 18 studies have been included in the review. Our results show that, despite therapists and public’s skepticism, telepsychotherapy is a trustworthy alternative to be adopted, which can be used efficaciously to treat common mental-health disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic distress. As well as in the traditional setting, a higher number of sessions and the proper management of patients’ expectations seem to be associated with better outcomes. On the contrary, low familiarity with web-based means of communication and technical issues might reduce specifically the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","coronavirus; COVID-19; distance psychotherapy; on-line psychotherapy; Telepsychotherapy",,,,,,,,,"(2013) Guidelines for the practice of telepsychology, 68 (9), pp. 791-800. , American Psychologist; Apolinário-Hagen, J., Vehreschild, V., Alkoudmani, R.M., Current views and perspectives on E-mental health: An exploratory survey study for understanding public attitudes toward internet-based psychotherapy in Germany (2017) JMIR Mental Health, 4 (1), p. e8; Brooks, S.K., Webster, R.K., Smith, L.E., Woodland, L., Wessely, S., Greenberg, N., Rubin, G.J., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence (2020) The Lancet, 395 (10227), pp. 912-920; Catarino, A., Bateup, S., Tablan, V., Innes, K., Freer, S., Richards, A., Blackwell, A.D., Demographic and clinical predictors of response to internet-enabled cognitive–behavioural therapy for depression and anxiety (2018) BJPsych Open, 4 (5), pp. 411-418. , …; Cipolletta, S., Frassoni, E., Faccio, E., Construing a therapeutic relationship online: An analysis of videoconference sessions (2018) Clinical Psychologist, 22 (2), pp. 220-229; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , Hillsdale N.L.E.A., (ed), 2nd, Hillsdale.

Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Loneliness; Sleep; Uncertainty; Worry","anxiety; Athens Insomnia Scale; attitude to illness; coronavirus disease 2019; De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale; depression; disease severity; Greek (people); human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; insomnia; Intolerance to Uncertainty scale; Letter; pandemic; Patient Health Questionnaire 2; policy; priority journal; rating scale; social behavior",,,,,,,,"Carleton, R.N., Norton, M.A.P.J., Asmundson, G.J.G., Fearing the unknown: a short version of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (2007) J.

The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people’s mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people. © 2020 by the authors.

We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Aim: To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. Methods: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Results: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion: Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed. © 2020 Author(s).","cross-sectional studies; epidemiological monitoring; schizophrenia",,,,,,"Program of Shanghai Academic Research Leader: 17XD1403300

The current study was conducted in the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain. The authors analyzed stress, anxiety, and depression with the arrival of the virus and the levels of symptoms according to age, comorbidity, and confinement. Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression were measured in a sample of 976 adults, using the DASS scale (Depression Anxiety, and Stress Scale). Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population. The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued. Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.

A cross-sectional study was conducted. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences & Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering & Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. In order to provide timely crisis-oriented psychological services and to take preventive measures in future pandemic situations, mental health in university students should be carefully monitored. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anxiety; Depression; Psychological impact; Stress; University students","adult; aged; anxiety; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; disease severity; emotionality; epidemic; female; health impact assessment; health survey; human; Impact of Events Scale; major clinical study; male; online analysis; priority journal; psychological aspect; scoring system; Spain; stress; university student; worker",,,,,"European Social Fund, ESF: 376062

Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest. © 2020 The Authors.

Mental health monitoring, early identification of at-risk individuals, and treatment irrespective of financial barriers are essential for minimizing chronic distress. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Disaster mental health; Emergency responders; PTSD","2019 novel coronavirus; alcoholism; Article; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; depression; family counseling; health care need; health care personnel; health hazard; health service; human; long term care; mental health; mental health care; monitoring; pandemic; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; mental health service; pandemic; psychology; survivor; terrorism; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; September 11 Terrorist Attacks; Survivors; Terrorism",,,,,"200-2017-93428","Drs.

Respiratory rehabilitation is an important intervention as well as cure for clinical patients. With increased understanding of COVID-19 and the accumulation of clinical experience, we proposed recommendations for respiratory rehabilitation in adults with COVID-19 based on the opinions of frontline clinical experts involved in the management of this epidemic and a review of the relevant literature and evidence. Our recommendations are as follows: 1. for inpatients with COVID-19, respiratory rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression and eventually improve physical functions and the quality of life; 2. for severe/critical inpatients, early respiratory rehabilitation is not suggested; 3. for patients in isolation, respiratory rehabilitation guidance should be conducted through educational videos, instruction manuals, or remote consultation; 4. assessment and monitoring should be performed throughout the respiratory rehabilitation process; 5. proper grade protection should be used following the present guidelines. These recommendations can guide clinical practice and form the basis for respiratory rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,25425641,,,"32251002","English","Chin. Med.

We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens aged≤18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%- 83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31-2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52-2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings implicated the government need pay more attention to mental health problems, especially depression and anxiety among general population and combating with ""infodemic"" while combating during public health emergency. © 2020 Gao et al.",,"adult; anxiety disorder; Article; China; Chinese; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; demography; depression; disease assessment; disease association; epidemic; female; geographic distribution; government; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; mental disease; middle aged; population exposure; population research; prevalence; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social media; social participation; adolescent; aged; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; mental health; pandemic; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Young Adult",,,,,,,,"WHO Director-General's Statement on IHR Emergency Committee on Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), , https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-statement-on-ihr-emergencycommittee-on-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov), WHO, (accessed Feb 9, 2020); Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) Situation Report-20, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200209-sitrep-20-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=6f80d1b9_4, WHO, (accessed Feb 9, 2020); Bao, Y., Sun, Y., Meng, S., Shi, J., Lu, L., 2019-nCoV epidemic: Address mental health care to empower society (2020) The Lancet., , Feb 07; Shigemura, J., Ursano, R.J., Morganstein, J.C., Kurosawa, M., Benedek, D.M., Public responses to the novel 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Japan: Mental health consequences and target populations (2020) Psychiatry Clin Neurosci, , Feb 08, PMID: 32034840; Kang, L., Li, Y., Hu, S., The mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2020) The Lancet Psychiatry, , Feb 05, (accessed Feb 11, 2020); Guideline for Psychological Crisis Intervention during 2019-nCoV, , http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/zhengceku/2020-01/27/content_5472433.htm, National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, (accessed Feb 10, 2020); Shultz, J.M., Baingana, F., Neria, Y., The 2014 Ebola Outbreak and Mental Health: Current Status and Recommended Response (2015) JAMA, 313 (6), pp. 567-568. , PMID: 25532102; Bontcheva, K., Gorrell, G., Wessels, B., (2013) Social Media and Information Overload: Survey Results, , https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1306.0813B, arXiv eprints, (accessed June 01, 2013); Roth, F., Brönnimann, G., Focal Report 8: Risk Analysis Using the Internet for Public Risk Communication, , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256126259, accessed Feb 12, 2020; COVID 2019 PHEIC Global Research and Innovation Forum: Towards a Research Roadmap, , https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/12-02-2020-world-experts-and-funders-set-priorities-for-covid-19-research, WHO, (accessed Feb 14, 2020); Neria, Y., Sullivan, G.M., Understanding the mental health effects of indirect exposure to mass trauma through the media (2011) JAMA, 306 (12), pp. 1374-1375. , PMID: 21903818; Choi, D.-H., Yoo, W., Noh, G.-Y., Park, K., The impact of social media on risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak in South Korea (2017) Computers in Human Behavior, 72, pp. 422-431; Huang, Y., Wang, Y., Wang, H., Prevalence of mental disorders in China: A cross-sectional epidemiological study (2019) Lancet Psychiatry, 6 (3), pp. 211-224. , PMID: 30792114; Chinese Version of the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, , http://www.who-5.org, WHO Collaborating Centre in Mental Health, (accessed Feb 10, 2020); Spitzer, R.L., Kroenke, K., Williams, J.B., Lowe, B., A brief measure for assessing generalized anxiety disorder: The GAD-7 (2006) Archives of Internal Medicine, 166 (10), pp. 1092-1097. , PMID: 16717171; Xu, W.F.P.Y., Chen, B.Q., Assessment of anxiety and depression by self-rating scales of gad-7 and phq-9 in cardiovascular outpatients (2018) World Latest Medicine Information (Electronic Version), 18 (16), pp. 12-14. , in Chinese; Xie, Z., Xu, J., Wu, Z., Mental health problems among survivors in hard-hit areas of the 5.12 Wenchuan and 4.20 Lushan earthquakes (2017) J Ment Health, 26 (1), pp. 43-49. , PMID: 28084103; Ji, D., Ji, Y.J., Duan, X.Z., Prevalence of psychological symptoms among Ebola survivors and healthcare workers during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone: A cross-sectional study (2017) Oncotarget, 8 (8), pp. 12784-12791. , PMID: 28061463; Mak, I.W., Chu, C.M., Pan, P.C., Yiu, M.G., Chan, V.L., Long-term psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors (2009) Gen Hosp Psychiatry, 31 (4), pp. 318-326. , PMID: 19555791; Bat Soup, Biolab, Crazy Numbers.

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Posttraumatic stress disease; Quarantine",,,,,,,,,"Asmundson, G.J.G., Taylor, S., Coronaphobia: Fear and the 2019-nCoV outbreak (2020) J.

People experiencing disability due to Covid-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. OBJECTIVES: To provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to Covid-19. The first rapid ""living"" review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. METHODS: A systematic search on PubMed, Pedro and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: ""Covid-19"", ""Coronavirus"", ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""rehabilitation"", ""physical therapy modalities"", ""exercise"", ""occupational therapy"", and ""late complications"". Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. RESULTS: Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, 9 were included in the present review. Four of them are ""calls for action"", 3 provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, 2 address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and 1 provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing Covid-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current Covid-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in Covid-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,19739095,,,"32316718","English","Eur J Phys Rehabil Med",Article,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084617386

There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

According to the knowledge of infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS, many patients and health care workers suffered from depression and anxiety during and after the epidemic. In particular, post-epidemic survivors were more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Similar conditions could be occurred during and after COVID-19. Therefore, it is also an important task to reduce the prevalence of PTSD after COVID-19 as much as possible and to relieve the tension of infected patients, first-line medical staff, quarantine personnel and so on. Traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages in the treatment of emotional diseases. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of PTSD by theory of traditional Chinese medicine and looking for effective methods to treat PTSD will be helpful to treat PTSD of survivors after COVID-19. It is found that Sini Powder has potential value in the treatment of PTSD by the summary and comparison of the research on traditional Chinese medicine related to the treatment of PTSD. We hope to overcome this epidemic psychologically and spiritually. Therefore, it is considered that Sini Powder can be used as the first choice for relieving emotional diseases of related patients during COVID-19 and treating PTSD of survivors after COVID-19. © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

Many reports suggested that psychological intervention is playing a positive role in COVID-19 treatment, but there is no high-quality evidence to prove its effects. This paper reports the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify effectiveness of psychological intervention during the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be used by 2 independent reviewers: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, WHO Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The randomised controlled trials of psychological intervention on COVID-19 will be searched in the databases by 2 researchers independently. Clinical recovery time and effective rate will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Changes of patients physical condition (1. Time until COVID-19 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratory tract specimen; 2. Time until cough reported as mild or absent; 3. Time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent; 4. Frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; 5. Frequency of requiring respiratory; 6. Incidence of severe cases; 7. Proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to ICU; 8. All-cause mortality; 9. Frequency of seriously adverse events) and changes of psychological condition (such as: SRQ-20, PHQ-9, GAD-7, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale) will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, such as effective rate, data will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated. Fixed effect model will be used for evaluating efficiency. Considering clinical heterogeneity, random effect model will be used for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Relevant studies will be used to evaluate whether psychological intervention is effective for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study will provide reliable evidence for psychological intervention on COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89±1.117), SDS (50.13±1.813), and PCL-C (50.13±1.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P<0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07±3.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%. CONCLUSIONS There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other. Hospitals should improve emergency management measures, strengthen psychological counseling for clinical front-line medical staff, strengthen exercise intervention, and improve their sleep quality and mental health.",,"adult; anxiety; China; coping behavior; Coronavirus infection; counseling; depression; health care personnel; human; kinesiotherapy; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep latency; virus pneumonia; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; China; Coronavirus Infections; Counseling; Depression; Dyssomnias; Exercise Therapy; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep; Sleep Latency; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,23254416,,,"32389999","English","Med Sci Monit Basic Res",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084398868

The psychological impact of the pandemic itself and the lockdown in particular is likely to be huge. Aim: To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on general population in West Bengal. Materials and Methods: It was an online survey which was conducted using Google Forms with link sent using WhatsApp. A 38-item self-designed questionnaire was used for the study. The survey questionnaire would take around 5-7 min to complete. Total 507 responses were received by the stipulated time. Results: Near about five-seventh (71.8%) and one-fifth (24.7%) of the respondents felt more worried and depressed, respectively, in the past 2 weeks. Half of the respondents (52.1%) were preoccupied with the idea of contracting COVID-19 and one-fifth (21.1%) of the respondents were repeatedly thinking of getting themselves tested for the presence of COVID-19 despite having no symptoms. Majority (69.6%) of the respondents were worried about the financial loss they were incurring during the period of lockdown. One-fourth (25.6%) and one-third (30.8%) of the respondents found that COVID-19 pandemic had threatened their existence and they found it difficult to adjust to the new routine during 21-day lockdown period, respectively. Conclusion: The index survey suggested that worry and sleep disturbances were common among the respondents in the past 2 weeks. The pandemic threatened the existence of the respondents to a great extent and affected their mental status negatively. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Corona virus disease; General population; Mental health; Psychological impact","adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cross-sectional study; depression; dyspnea; female; fever; financial deficit; health survey; human; India; male; mental health; online system; pandemic; psychological aspect; quarantine; questionnaire; sadness; sleep disorder; sleep waking cycle; sneezing; social distance; thinking; West Bengal",,,,,,,,"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, Coronavirus [Last accessed on 2020 Mar 30]; https://www.covid19india.Org, India COVID-19 Tracker [Last accessed on 2020 Mar 30]; https://www.mohfw.gov.in, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective: To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods: The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions: The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL. © 2020","Anxiety; Common variable immunodeficiencies; Coronavirus; COVID-19; COVID-19 epidemic; Depression; General Health Questionnaire; Health-related quality of life; Remote assistance","immunoglobulin; adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; common variable immunodeficiency; Coronavirus infection; depression; female; home infusion therapy; human; Italy; male; middle aged; pandemic; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; subcutaneous drug administration; telemedicine; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Common Variable Immunodeficiency; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Home Infusion Therapy; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Infusions, Subcutaneous; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Young Adult",,"immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; Immunoglobulins",,,,"We thank all patients for their participation in the study as well as the study team and nurses of the local health units whose enthusiastic collaboration made possible this study.

Methods: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). Results: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them. They were in need of attention and recovery programs. © 2020 S.

Negative self-perceptions of aging, among other personal and relational variables may be associated with loneliness and distress caused by the pandemic crisis. METHOD: Participants are 1310 Spanish people (age range: 18-88 years) during a lock-down period at home. In addition to specific questions about risk for COVID-19, self-perceptions of aging, family and personal resources, loneliness and psychological distress were measured. Hierarchical regression analyses were done for assessing the correlates of loneliness and psychological distress. RESULTS: The measured variables allow for an explanation of 48% and 33% of the variance of distress and loneliness, respectively. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, more contact with relatives different to those that co-reside, fewer positive emotions, less perceived self-efficacy, lower quality of sleep, higher expressed emotion and higher loneliness were associated with higher distress. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, lower contact with relatives, higher self-perception as a burden, fewer positive emotions, lower resources for entertaining oneself, lower quality of sleep and higher expressed emotion were associated with higher loneliness. © The Author(s) 2020.

The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them. © 2020",,"anxiety; Article; behavior assessment; consensus; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; fear; gambling; game addiction; human; information technology; internet addiction; pornography; reinforcement; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stress; substance use; treatment planning; anxiety disorder; Betacoronavirus; consensus; coping behavior; Coronavirus infection; Internet; pandemic; psychology; video game; virus pneumonia; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Humans; Internet; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Video Games",,,,,"Wellcome Trust, WT: 110049/Z/15/Z

The study focuses on assess the psychological status of them. The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires. Occurrence of fear, anxiety and depression were measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS) on fear, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors’ institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory, emergency, infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression. The medical staff especially working in above-mentioned departments made them more susceptible to psychological disorders.

Sleep is crucial for child and adolescent health and well-being, and the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high. This may be particularly true for children and adolescents who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and mental health disturbances and for those whom developmental changes impacting sleep are rapidly occurring. Youth with preexisting psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder) could be especially vulnerable to disturbed sleep during this period of change and uncertainty. It is thus imperative that sleep considerations be part of research and clinical initiatives aimed at understanding and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in children and adolescents.

Prolongadas estancias en casa podrían generar miedo, pánico, ansiedad y estados de depresión, los cuales pueden a su vez generar estilos de vida sedentarios. Por ello, ante esta situación excepcional de cuarentena generada por la enfermedad del Covid-19, puede ser relevante determinar cuál es el estado psicológico de la población, así como la influencia que el nivel de ejercicio físico desarrollado en casa puede tener sobre estos parámetros. Para ello, se está elaborando un estudio multicéntrico, transversal y observacional, desarrollado en 12 países iberoamericanos e involucrando a 3.096 personas, a través de una técnica de muestreo de bola de nieve. Los datos serán recogidos entre marzo y agosto de 2020 por medio de cuestionarios electrónicos que incluirán: datos demográficos, estado de salud, impacto psicológico del brote de Covid-19, estado mental, y nivel de actividad física. El estudio será desarrollado siguiendo los principios establecidos en la Declaración de Helsinki y siguiendo las consideraciones éticas de la investigación clínica.

The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were ≥18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted. Results: Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 ± 11.94 years. After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms β =.11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02–0.20. Mediation analysis showed that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 mediated 34.4% of this relationship (β =.04; 95%CI = 0.01–0.06). Conclusion: Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 can serve as a pathway through which exposure to COVID-19 news on mainstream media may be associated with depressive symptoms. Based on our findings, we offered recommendations for media–health partnership, practice, and research. © 2020 The British Psychological Society","COVID-19; depression; mainstream media; risk perception",,,,,,,,,"Ajzen, I., (2002) Constructing a TPB questionnaire: Conceptual and methodological considerations, , http://www.people.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.measurement.pdf, Retrieved from; Atton, C., News cultures and new social movements: Radical journalism and the mainstream media (2002) Journalism Studies, 3, pp. 491-505. , https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670022000019209; Bish, A., Michie, S., Demographic and attitudinal determinants of protective behaviours during a pandemic: A review (2010) British Journal of Health Psychology, 15, pp. 797-824. , https://doi.org/10.1348/135910710X485826; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html, Retrieved from; (2020) Recovering patients describe what it's like to contract coronavirus – CNN video, , https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/02/13/china-coronavirus-survivors-culver-pkg-ctw-intl-hnk-vpx.cnn, Retrieved from; Cowper, A., Covid-19: Are we getting the communications right?

Further these symptoms are likely to exacerbate alcohol or drug use, especially for those vulnerable to relapse. The nature of COVID-19 and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a four-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those that recover form COVID-19, healthcare professionals and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption. The important thing is to have a systematic plan to support behavioral health and to engage citizens in the prevention and doing their part in recovery by staying home and protecting others.

Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

Physical activity is useful in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and lung diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, cancer and depression. Recent studies correlate inactivity with chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity, at the origin of chronic non-communicable diseases. The evidence must be taken seriously into consideration in this particular CoViD-19 emergency period and long-term effects of prolonged limitation of sports activity must not be overlooked. Contagion in open places is very difficult and the absolute prohibition of sports activities in open places and the closure of parks are creating discomfort and confusion. Institutions and media are generating the wrong message that active people must be looked at with disapproval. Instead, this habit should be encouraged, in order to protect citizens' and community health, lightening the welfare load for society. © 2020 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

Isolation is strongly linked to depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline, and reduces resilience factors such as self-worth, sense of purpose and feeling valued (Novotney, 2019).

In this context, we decided to rapidly design and implement a psychological support system for all hospital workers in Paris during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods: We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers. Results: After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support. Conclusions: This psychological support system can be easily duplicated and seems to benefit all hospital professions that all appeared psychologically affected. © Copyright © 2020 Geoffroy, Le Goanvic, Sabbagh, Richoux, Weinstein, Dufayet and Lejoyeux.","healthcare workers; medical workers; mental health; psychiatry; psychological intervention; psychology","adult; anger; anxiety disorder; Article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; epidemic; female; health care personnel; health care policy; human; insomnia; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; nonmedical occupations; patient referral; professional burnout; psychiatric treatment; psychiatrist; psychologist; psychosis; psychosocial care; telemedicine; traumatology; volunteer",,,,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395; Wu, C., Chen, X., Cai, Y., Xia, J., Zhou, X., Xu, S., Risk Factors Associated With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Death in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Intern Med, ,  ; Gouvernement.fr, , https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus, Accessed; Greenberg, N., Docherty, M., Gnanapragasam, S., Wessely, S., Managing mental health challenges faced by healthcare workers during covid-19 pandemic (2020) BMJ, 368; Kang, L., Li, Y., Hu, S., Chen, M., Yang, C., Yang, B.X., The mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2020) Lancet Psychiatry, 7, p. e14; Li, Z., Ge, J., Yang, M., Feng, J., Qiao, M., Jiang, R., Vicarious traumatization in the general public, members, and non-members of medical teams aiding in COVID-19 control (2020) Brain Behav Immun, , (,) S0889-1591(20):30309-3.  ; Lai, J., Ma, S., Wang, Y., Cai, Z., Hu, J., Wei, N., Factors Associated With Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (2020) JAMA Netw Open, 3, p. e203976; Albert, R.R., (2005) Crisis intervention handbook: Assessment, treatment, and research, , 3rd ed., New York, NY, US, Oxford University Press; Maunder, R., Hunter, J., Vincent, L., Bennett, J., Peladeau, N., Leszcz, M., The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital (2003) CMAJ, 168 (10); Nickell, L.A., Crighton, E.J., Tracy, C.S., Al-Enazy, H., Bolaji, Y., Hanjrah, S., Psychosocial effects of SARS on hospital staff: survey of a large tertiary care institution (2004) CMAJ, 170; Maunder, R., The experience of the 2003 SARS outbreak as a traumatic stress among frontline healthcare workers in Toronto: lessons learned (2004) Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci, 359","Geoffroy, P.A.; Department of Psychiatry and Addictive Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), University Hospital Bichat, Department of Psychiatry and Addictive Medicine, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), University Hospital Bichat, Université de Paris, NeuroDiderot, Inserm, Sector of Psychiatry, G.H.U.

The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality. © 2020",,,,,,,,,,"CDC coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores. Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long term traditional meditation practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme. Mindfulness and meditation practices translate well to different populations across the life span and range of ability.

Although dying is part of life, the risk for some doctors may be greater. Specifically, gastroenterologists are affected by the fear of restarting medical check-ups and endoscopic procedures. Amid a sea of information –even with contradictions between different experts— following the guidelines of the Colombian Associations of the Digestive Tract could help reassure doctors and patients. Although the pathologies will continue to appear, the fear of the population to be infected can generate consequences such as delaying the treatment of digestive tract cancers. Physical self-care through protection strategies and the emotional care, are important to help our immune system.

To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10, 2020, Italy has been under a total lockdown, forcing people into home confinement. Here we present data from 1,310 people living in the Italian territory (Mage = 23.91 ± 3.60 years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 university students), who completed an online survey from March 24 to March 28, 2020. In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17–23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3–10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions. © 2020 European Sleep Research Society","bedtime; circadian rhythms; depression; home confinement; social isolation; time perception",,,,,,,,,"Altena, E., Baglioni, C., Espie, C.A., Ellis, J., Gavriloff, D., Holzinger, B., Riemann, D., Dealing with sleep problems during home confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak: Practical recommendations from a task force of the European CBT-I Academy (2020) Journal of Sleep Research, , https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13052; Bottesi, G., Ghisi, M., Altoè, G., Conforti, E., Melli, G., Sica, C., The Italian version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21: Factor structure and psychometric properties on community and clinical samples (2015) Comprehensive Psychiatry, 60, pp. 170-181. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2015.04.005; Brooks, S.K., Webster, R.K., Smith, L.E., Woodland, L., Wessely, S., Greenberg, N., Rubin, G.J., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence (2020) Lancet, 395 (10227), pp. 912-920. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8; Curcio, G., Tempesta, D., Scarlata, S., Marzano, C., Moroni, F., Rossini, P.M., De Gennaro, L., Validity of the Italian version of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) (2013) Neurological Sciences, 34 (4), pp. 511-519. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-012-1085-y; Gradisar, M., Wolfson, A.R., Harvey, A.G., Hale, L., Rosenberg, R., Czeisler, C.A., The sleep and technology use of Americans: Findings from the National Sleep Foundation's 2011 sleep in America poll (2013) Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, 9 (12), pp. 1291-1299. , https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.3272; (2020) Comunicato stampa N°19/2020.

His behaviour worsened, necessitating heavy sedation and transfer to intensive care for mechanical ventilation despite no respiratory indication. Investigations confirmed that he was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Neuroimaging and a lumbar puncture were normal. Initial screening for SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid was negative although no validated assay was available. The patient's mental state remained abnormal following stepdown from intensive care. Psychiatric assessment found features consistent with acute mania, and he was detained under the Mental Health Act.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Chinese citizens aged≥18 by a designed and distributed structured self-filling electronic questionnaire. Individual's media exposure, health behavior cognition, mental health status and other information were collected during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020.Chi-square tests and Logistic regressions were used for statistical analysis. Results: Among 4 827 participants with an average age of (32.32±9.98) years old (ranging 18-85 years old), 32.3% of participants were males, 2.7% from Hubei Province. Media exposure was 38.4% for more than 3 hours per day and 22.7% for less than 1 hour. Prevalence of anxiety and major anxiety were 53.3% and 9.6%.Prevalence of depression was 48.3%.Higher media exposure was associated with more complete preventive measures taken (ρ=0.091, P<0.001), higher risk perception (ρ=0.04, P=0.008), and higher self-efficacy (ρ=0.07, P<0.001).The odds ratio of anxiety and depression in participants with more than 3 hours of media exposure were 1.30 (95%CI:1.09-1.58) times and 1.23 (95%CI:1.05-1.43) times respectively compared to those with less than 1 hour of media exposure per day.

We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (Ro) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten. Toxoplasmosis needs the digestive tract of the feline to survive. Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans. © 2020","Evolutionary medicine; Host-pathogen interaction","cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; Article; asymptomatic infection; behavior change; cholesterol blood level; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; depression; human; incubation time; infection risk; mood disorder; schizophrenia; separation anxiety; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social behavior; social exclusion; social interaction; social isolation; social support; suicidal behavior; virus cell interaction; virus mutation; virus pneumonia; virus transmission",,"cholesterol, 57-88-5",,,,,,"Herbison, R., Lagrue, C., Poulin, R., The missing link in parasite manipulation of host behavior (2018) Parasit Vectors, 11, p. 222; Johnson, K.V.-A., Foster, K.R., Why does Microbiome affect behavior?

Treatment strategies for mental illness include psychotherapy and psychopharmacological interventions. The latter are associated with a multitude of adverse drug reactions (ADR); however, they may currently represent the preferred treatment due to restrictions regarding patient care (i.e. social distancing). Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to a worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to a surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adverse drug reactions (ADR); Drug safety; Infection; Psychiatry; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)",,,,,,,,,"Aitken, A.E., Richardson, T.A., Morgan, E.T., Regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in inflammation (2006) Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol, 46, pp. 123-149. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28XisFKltLk%3D; Alvir, J.M., Lieberman, J.A., Safferman, A.Z., Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis.

Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it. Methods and results: The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner. Conclusions: We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions. Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall. These procedural tricks would enhance diagnostic reliability. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,"2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html; Winichakoon, P., Chaiwarith, R., Liwsrisakun, C., Negative nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab does not rule out COVID-19 (2020) J Clin Microbiol, 26, pp. 00297-00220; Lippi, G., Simundic, A.M., Plebani, M., Potential preanalytical and analytical vulnerabilities in the laboratory diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Clin Chem Lab Med, , https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0285; Tsang, O.T., Chik-Yan Yip, C., Consistent detection of 2019 novel coronavirus in saliva (2020) Clin Infect Dis, 12. , https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa149; Tsang, O.T., Leung, W.S., Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, 20 (5), pp. 565-574","Torretta, S.; Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore PoliclinicoItaly; email: sara.torretta@unimi.it",,,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",,,,,10433074,,HEANE,"32441380","English","Head Neck",Conference Paper,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085307664

We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients’ neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after five weeks of lockdown in Spain. Methods: We tested 40 subjects with a diagnosis of MCI (20) or mild AD (20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of Cognitive Disorders Unit. All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and they were re-evaluated after 5 weeks of lockdown. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D were used to evaluate the neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life of patients and caregivers. Results: The total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28) vs 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (p=0.028). The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms affected were apathy (4.15 (3.78) vs 5.75 (4.02); p=0.002) and anxiety (3.95 (3.73) vs 5.30 (4.01); p=0.006) in MCI patients and apathy (2.35 (2.70) vs 3.75 (3.78); p=0.036), agitation (0.45 (1.14) vs 1.50 (2.66); p=0.029) and aberrant motor behaviour (1.25 (2.86) vs 2.00 (2.93); p=0.044) in AD patients. We did not observe differences in EuroQol-5D scores during the reevaluation. Approximately 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of their health status during confinement. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5 weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.

In this paper, fear and its possible forthcoming consequences on health will be investigated and discussed. Fear is an innate reactive emotion to the immediate threats produced by danger. It is hardwired within subcortical survival circuits and originally had to defend the organism from predators. Besides, fear is a cognitive emotional process mediated by the cortical structures, and implies a subjective evaluation both at implicit (subsymbolic, unconscious) and explicit (symbolic, conscious) levels. Within a defensive taxonomy framework, fear can be defined as a reflex triggering a prompt behavior aimed at surviving from predating attacks (freezing), whereas anxiety as a deliberate pattern aimed at planning behaviors for anticipating and avoiding future harm. Fear and anxiety overlap at a subjective level, but are generated by different neurobiological networks and serve different evolutionary goals. The current viral danger and the need for social distancing worsen the sense of loneliness. A wide body of experimental and epidemiological literature evidence that psychological stress, social isolation, and loneliness have a detrimental effect on multiple health-related outcomes including comorbidity, multimorbidity, and mortality. The negative effects can be even higher for people currently living a massive limitation of physical and interpersonal contacts. A strong effort to integrate psychological and medical care is needed to face post-pandemic health issues. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.","Anxiety; Fear; Loneliness; Neurobiology; Psychosomatics","C reactive protein; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; anxiety; Article; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; epidemic; General Health Questionnaire; human; loneliness; mental stress; mortality; multiple chronic conditions; obesity; perception; posttraumatic stress disorder; social distance; social isolation",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4",,,,,,"Amanzio, M., Pollo, A., Maggi, G., Benedetti, F., Response Variability to Analgesics: A Role for Non-Specific Activation of Endogenous Opioids (2001) Pain, 90, pp. 205-215. , https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3959(00)00486-3; (2013) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, , 5th ed.

Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results: Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions: Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Mental health disorders; People experiencing homelessness","behavioral addiction; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease association; disease predisposition; exposure; health care access; health disparity; homeless person; homelessness; human; immunopathology; infection risk; Letter; life expectancy; mental disease; patient isolation; physical disability; prevalence; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virogenesis; virus transmission; anxiety disorder; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; female; health care delivery; homeless person; housing; male; mental disease; mental health; pandemic; psychology; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Homeless Persons; Housing; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Vulnerable Populations",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Design/methodology/approach: A review of brand marketing and advertising from the 1920s and 1930s. Findings: There are many learnings from the Great Depression that are instructive for today’s brand marketers dealing with COVID-19. Research limitations/implications: The review of the literature is not comprehensive and the findings are subjective. Practical implications: Today’s brands can learn a great deal from the 1930s such as to take advantage of opportunities and avoid mistakes in today’s difficult environment. Social implications: By handling today’s challenges skillfully, brands can refresh relationships with consumers overwhelmed with choices. Originality/value: Though there was some commentary on this subject following the Great Recession of 2009, there has been little written about the lessons in brand marketing in the current situation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand marketing; Consumerism; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Great depression; Pandemic",,,,,,,,,"Amadeo, K., Anderson, S., Unemployment rate by year since 1929 compared to inflation and GDP (2020) The Balance, , www.thebalance.com/unemployment-rate-by-year-3305506, (accessed: 19 April 2020; Barton, B., (1925) The Man Nobody Knows, , Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis; Benchley, R., How to sell goods (1920) New York World, , http://americainclass.org/sources/becomingmodern/prosperity/text3/howtosellgoods.pdf, (accessed: 19 April 2020; Chase, S., Schlink, F., (1928) Your Money’s Worth, , Macmillan, New York, NY; Crafts, N., Long-term unemployment in Britain in the 1930s (1987) The Economic History Review, 40 (3). , www.jstor.org/stable/2596253?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Aea6bebbfa46194e704725a7d1f6055ec&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents, (accessed: 19 April 2020; Dimsdale, N., Horsewood, N., van Riel, A., Unemployment in inter-war Germany: an analysis of the labor market, 1927-1936 (2006) Journal of Economic History, , www.jstor.org/stable/3874859?read-now=1&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents, (accessed: 19 April 2020; Hua, Y., (2009) The Great Depression in Washington, DC State: Changing Advertising Trends in the Seattle Times during the Great Depression, , https://depts.washington.edu/depress/advertising.shtml, (accessed, University of Washington, DC: 19 April 2020; Hulbert, M., 25 years to bounce back?

Methods UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight–flight–freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight–flight–freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related). Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. © 2020 The Authors.

AIMS: To assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the sleep quality of healthcare workers in a children's healthcare centre in Wuhan. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Children's Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). RESULTS: In total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores > 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.40 (1.21-9.57), P < 0.05), exposure to COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.97 (1.08-8.18), P < 0.05) and depression (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.83 (1.10-7.27), P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that, during the outbreak of COVID-19, sleep disturbance was highly prevalent among paediatric healthcare workers, and sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child, exposure to COVID-19 patients and depression. Therefore, more mental health services are required for front-line paediatric healthcare workers in Wuhan. © The Author(s) 2020.

In this context, the aim of this study was to analyze whether the levels of depression, anxiety and stress in university students have changed during the period of the pandemic (2020) compared with the previous normality. This study comprised two groups, in which sample-1 is composed of 460 subjects with a mean age of 20.14 and sample-2, 159 subjects with a mean age of 20.40. All the participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and were assessed by way of the Anxiety, Depression and Stress Scales. The students evaluated during the period of the pandemic presented significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress, compared with students in erstwhile, normal times. Our results suggest that the pandemic has a negative psychological effect on students. It is important to continue exploring the implications of the pandemic on students’ mental health, so that its effects can be prevented, or at least mitigated. © 2020, PUC de Campinas.

In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method:: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results:: Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions:: As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects. Doctors, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Health professionals; Psychic exhaustion","attitude to death; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; data base; death; depression; disease association; emotional stress; health personnel attitude; health practitioner; human; job stress; Letter; mental health; mortality rate; priority journal; shift work; adult; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; depression; disease transmission; doctor patient relationship; epidemic; health care personnel; Italy; pandemic; physician; psychology; terminal care; virus pneumonia; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Death; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Health Personnel; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Professional-to-Patient; Italy; Mental Health; Pandemics; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Terminal Care",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Several case reports have demonstrated that the respiratory system is the main target in patients with COVID-19, but the disease is not limited to the respiratory system. Case analysis indicated that the nervous system can be invaded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that 36.4% of COVID-19 patients had neurological symptoms. Importantly, the involvement of the CNS may be associated with poor prognosis and disease worsening. Here, we discussed the symptoms and evidence of nervous system involvement (directly and indirectly) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible mechanisms. CNS symptoms could be a potential indicator of poor prognosis; therefore, the prevention and treatment of CNS symptoms are also crucial for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Central nervous system; COVID-19; Infection; SARS-CoV-2","corticotropin; corticotropin releasing factor; furosemide; glucocorticoid receptor; mannitol; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; psychotropic agent; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus receptor; anxiety; central nervous system infection; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; counseling; depression; dizziness; head and neck disease; headache; human; hypogeusia; hyposmia; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; intracranial hypertension; mental disease; nausea; nonhuman; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; prognosis; psychotherapy; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stress; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular disease; complication; consciousness disorder; Coronavirus infection; dizziness; endothelium cell; fatigue; headache; intracranial hypertension; mental disease; metabolism; mood disorder; multimodality cancer therapy; nerve cell; neurologic disease; olfactory nerve; pandemic; pathogenicity; prevalence; psychology; retrospective study; sensory dysfunction; virology; virus encephalitis; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Combined Modality Therapy; Consciousness Disorders; Coronavirus Infections; Dizziness; Encephalitis, Viral; Endothelial Cells; Fatigue; Headache; Humans; Intracranial Hypertension; Mental Disorders; Mood Disorders; Nervous System Diseases; Neurons; Olfactory Nerve; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Prognosis; Psychotherapy; Psychotropic Drugs; Receptors, Virus; Retrospective Studies; Sensation Disorders; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,"corticotropin, 11136-52-0, 9002-60-2, 9061-27-2; corticotropin releasing factor, 9015-71-8, 178359-01-8, 79804-71-0, 86297-72-5, 86784-80-7; furosemide, 54-31-9; mannitol, 69-65-8, 87-78-5; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Psychotropic Drugs; Receptors, Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2",,,"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province: ZR2019ZD32

We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. Result: There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score ≥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, p = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0–7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, p = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2–0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, p = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0–2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6–3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3–3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, p = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3–8.5). Conclusion: Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Yang, Liu, Ma, Wang, Cai, Du, Li, Kang, Su, Zhang, Liu and Zhang.","COVID-19; insomnia; isolation; medical staff; mental health; outbreak; sleep quality; stress","adult; anxiety; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; depression; disease association; educational status; epidemic; female; human; infection control; infection risk; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; major clinical study; male; medical staff; middle aged; physician; prevalence; psychosocial care; questionnaire; social media; social psychology; social status; young adult",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NNSF

Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods: We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results: We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions: Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Central nervous system; COVID-19; Daytime sleepiness; Dysgeusia; Hyposmia; Neurological symptoms; Neurology; SARS-CoV2 infection; Sex; Sleep impairment",,,,,,,,,"Baig, A.M., Khaleeq, A., Ali, U., Syeda, H., Evidence of the COVID-19 virus targeting the CNS: tissue distribution, host-virus interaction, and proposed neurotropic mechanisms (2020) ACS Chem.

Methods Search of the MEDLINE database for relevant studies related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. Results Across 13 identified studies, quarantine measures were consistently associated with negative psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, posttraumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization. Determinants comprised duration of quarantine measures and income losses. Health care workers constituted a particularly vulnerable group. Conclusion Quarantine measures during serious coronavirus outbreaks have extensive negative consequences for mental health. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Although the national medical staff and Public Health Epidemic Prevention personnel are fighting the epidemic, the large numbers of patients and the long-term isolation measures greatly impacted people's lifestyles. The epidemic's development has currently been eased, but the blockades and quarantines in many cities have not been completely lifted. While controlling the coronavirus, lifestyle changes caused by long-term isolation, as well as fear of the disease and economic recession have brought people various negative emotions. These mental health issues may cause or aggravate the occurrence and development of dry eye. Therefore, the authors explore the impact of mental health on dry eye during the COVID-19 epidemic, alongside possible mechanisms, and put forward relevant suggestions for managing eye-related diseases during and after the epidemic.

This is particularly relevant for the onset or exacerbation of pathological contamination fears in people with vulnerability to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or in those individuals with sub-threshold obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or who achieved recovery after a successful treatment. Strict movement restrictions and hygiene habits are essential to limit Covid-19 diffusion and delay its progression. However, the occurrence of dysfunctional, clinically relevant contamination fears may be the downside highlighting the importance of a more comprehensive knowledge on the vulnerability factors of OCD in order to inform policy making and risk communication on one hand, early identification and prevention on the other one. The importance of early identification and prevention of OCD during critical periods, such as the present one, is of paramount importance since this psychiatric condition is associated with a prolonged latency in the correct diagnosis and first professional contact which is in turn associated with worse prognosis and higher resistance to treatment. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.","Contamination fear; Covid-19; Early identification; Early intervention; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Prevention","Article; awareness; cognitive behavioral therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; disease exacerbation; fear; health care personnel; human; hygiene; infection prevention; intervention study; obsessive compulsive disorder; psychoeducation; psychological well-being; quarantine; risk factor; social distance; viral contamination",,,,,,,,"Barcaccia, B., Baiocco, R., Pozza, A., Pallini, S., Mancini, F., Salvati, M., The more you judge the worse you feel.

We are constantly threatened by the danger of i) being infected, ii) infecting other people, and (iii) by the loss of social relation. Departing from these premises, we here aim to investigate the psychological and neurodynamics of this complex phenomenon. First, we discuss about recent psychological and neuronal findings on fear and its disorders, related to an unbalanced intero-exteroceptive processing and emotional regulation. Secondly we move to the psychological and neuronal dynamics of self and others characterized by a temporo-spatial alignment with the world. Due to the neural overlap of emotion and self and the deep-reaching neuro-ecological layers of self, emotional feelings like fear and anxiety cannot be detached and dissociated from the world; they signify the world–brain relation, and, more specifically, our self-other relation. The deepest neuro-ecological and neuro-social layers of self are threatened by the loss of subjectivity, which is manifest in our loss of body and thus the fear of dying, and the loss of intersubjectivity that surfaces in our fear of infecting others, which reflect the intimate anchorage of the self with the world. In our opinion the pandemic of COVID-19 deeply affect our sense of self and its spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics providing the prerequisites for the manifestation of fear and existential anxiety, thus disrupting the brain-world relation with significant repercussions on our psyche and on our daily lives. © Clinical Neuropsychiatry.","COVID-19;

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2019 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research Co., Ltd.","Adverse events; Chloroquine; COVID-19; FAERS; Pharmacovigilance; Real-world data","chloroquine; aged; Betacoronavirus; drug surveillance program; factual database; female; Food and Drug Administration; human; isolation and purification; male; mental disease; middle aged; retrospective study; toxicity and intoxication; United States; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; Chloroquine",,,"Food and Drug Administration, FDA

Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO were searched. Study selection: Original studies reporting clinical outcomes of adult SARS and MERS survivors 3 months after admission or 2 months after discharge were included. Data extraction: Studies were graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was used to derive pooled estimates for prevalence/severity of outcomes up to 6 months after hospital discharge, and beyond 6 months after discharge. Data synthesis: Of 1,169 identified studies, 28 were included in the analysis. Pooled analysis revealed that common complications up to 6 months after discharge were: impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (prevalence 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15-45%); and reduced exercise capacity (mean 6-min walking distance 461 m, CI 450-473 m). The prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (39%, 95% CI 31-47%), depression (33%, 95% CI 20-50%) and anxiety (30%, 95% CI 10-61) beyond 6 months after discharge were considerable. Low scores on Short-Form 36 were identified beyond 6 months after discharge. Conclusion: Lung function abnormalities, psychological impairment and reduced exercise capacity were common in SARS and MERS survivors. Clinicians should anticipate and investigate similar long-term outcomes in COVID-19 survivors. © 2020 Foundation for Rehabilitation Information.

Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors’ symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift. National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families. Virtual funeral services, pairing bereaved elders with a telephone companion, remote counseling, and encouraging “continuing bonds” may help older adults adapt to loss in the time of pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","Bereavement; coping; COVID-19; death and dying; mental health; stress",,,,,,,,,"Bonanno, G.A., Loss, trauma, and human resilience: Have we underestimated the human capacity to thrive after extremely aversive events?

The study aimed to determine the extent to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may aggravate the prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology of pregnant women. Material and methods: Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated, one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 496) through advertisements in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the other (n = 1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from 2 April to 13 April 2020. Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Results: The 1754 pregnant women (Mage = 29.27, SD = 4.23) were between 4 and 41 gestational weeks (M = 24.80, SD = 9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had post-high-school training), and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low-income cut-off). A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education, and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks’ λ = 0.68, F6,1400 = 108.50, P &lt;.001, partial η2 = 0.32). According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ES = 0.57), dissociative symptoms (ES = 0.22 and ES = 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ES = 0.19), and negative affectivity (ES = 0.96), and less positive affectivity (ES = 0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.94, χ2[1] = 10.05, P =.002). Multiple regression analyses indicated that pregnant women in the COVID-19 cohort having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions: Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance. © 2020 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","anxiety;

The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","battery depletion; coronavirus; COVID-19; DBS withdrawal; telemedicine",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,1877718X,,,"32333552","English","J Parkinsons Dis",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616736

The absence of the dystrophin protein leads to a complex cascade of pathogenic events in myofibres, including chronic inflammation and oxidative stress as well as altered metabolism. The attention towards dietary supplements in DMD is rapidly increasing, with the aim to counteract pathology-related alteration in nutrient intake, the consequences of catabolic distress or to enhance the immunological response of patients as nowadays for the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. By definition, supplements do not exert therapeutic actions, although a great confusion may arise in daily life by the improper distinction between supplements and therapeutic compounds. For most supplements, little research has been done and little evidence is available concerning their effects in DMD as well as their preventing actions against infections. Often these are not prescribed by clinicians and patients/caregivers do not discuss the use with their clinical team. Then, little is known about the real extent of supplement use in DMD patients. It is mistakenly assumed that, since compounds are of natural origin, if a supplement is not effective, it will also do no harm. However, supplements can have serious side effects and also have harmful interactions, in terms of reducing efficacy or leading to toxicity, with other therapies. It is therefore pivotal to shed light on this unclear scenario for the sake of patients. This review discusses the supplements mostly used by DMD patients, focusing on their potential toxicity, due to a variety of mechanisms including pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions and contaminations, as well as on reports of adverse events. This overview underlines the need for caution in uncontrolled use of dietary supplements in fragile populations such as DMD patients. A culture of appropriate use has to be implemented between clinicians and patients’ groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adverse drug reactions; COVID-19; Dietary supplements; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Safety; SARS-CoV-2","acetylcysteine; androstenedione; antisense oligonucleotide; arginine; branched chain amino acid; citrulline; creatine; curcumin; dystrophin; epigallocatechin gallate; eteplirsen; fish oil; glucocorticoid; glutamine; golodirsen; heparin; leucine; melatonin; nutraceutical; nutrition supplement; omega 3 fatty acid; placebo; prasterone; resveratrol; sinecatechins; taurine; ubidecarenone; unindexed drug; utrophin; vitamin D; abdominal distension; abdominal pain; abnormal sensation; acute hepatitis; acute kidney failure; acute lung injury; adjuvant therapy; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amnesia; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; angina pectoris; angioneurotic edema; anorexia; aphasia; arthralgia; asthenia; asthma; atelectasis; atrial fibrillation; attention disturbance; backache; balance disorder; bleeding; blister; bloating; blurred vision; brain hemorrhage; bronchospasm; burning sensation; cataract; cell therapy; cerebrovascular accident; cheilitis; chill; cold sweat; complete heart block; confusion; constipation; contusion; convulsion; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid induced osteoporosis; coughing; decreased appetite; dehydration; depressed blood pressure; depression; diarrhea; diet supplementation; dietary supplement; disorientation; dizziness; drug blood level; drug contamination; drug megadose; drug potentiation; drug recall; drug safety; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; dysarthria; dysgeusia; dyskinesia; dysphagia; dyspnea; ear disease; ecchymosis; elevated blood pressure; energy drink; erythema; esophagus pain; evening dosage; face edema; failure to thrive; faintness; fatigue; fever; flank pain; flatulence; gait disorder; gallbladder disease; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; gene therapy; gingiva pain; hair disease; halitosis; headache; hearing impairment; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; heart infarction; heart palpitation; heart supraventricular arrhythmia; heartburn; hematuria; hepatic encephalopathy; hepatitis; hepatomegaly; human; hypercalcemia; hyperhidrosis; hyperkalemia; hypersensitivity; hypertension; hypertransaminasemia; hyperventilation; hypesthesia; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; hypokinesia; hyponatremia; hypophosphatemia; hypotension; iatrogenic disease; insomnia; insulin resistance; iron deficiency anemia; jaundice; jaw pain; joint swelling; kidney dysfunction; kidney failure; kidney pain; kidney tubule necrosis; lethargy; limb pain; liver failure; liver pain; lymphadenopathy; malaise; migraine without aura; motor dysfunction; muscle atrophy; muscle cramp; muscle metabolism; muscle necrosis; muscle spasm; muscle strength; muscle weakness; musculoskeletal stiffness; myalgia; myopathy; myotonia; nausea; neck pain; nephrolithiasis; neurologic disease; neutropenia; nocturia; nonhuman; osteomalacia; pain; panic; papular rash; paresthesia; peripheral edema; peripheral neuropathy; peripheral swelling; phlebitis; pleura effusion; priority journal; protein synthesis; pruritus; rash; recommended drug dose; rectum hemorrhage; retinol intoxication; Review; rhabdomyolysis; sarcopenia; seizure; serum sickness; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; sinus congestion; skin discoloration; skin disease; skin exfoliation; skull fracture; sleep disorder; speech disorder; spider vein; stomach discomfort; tachycardia; thorax pain; throat tightness; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; thrush; tongue edema; transient ischemic attack; tremor; upper abdominal pain; urinary urgency; urticaria; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin D intoxication; vomiting; weakness; wheezing; xerostomia",,"acetylcysteine, 616-91-1; androstenedione, 26264-53-9, 63-05-8; arginine, 1119-34-2, 15595-35-4, 7004-12-8, 74-79-3; citrulline, 372-75-8; creatine, 57-00-1; curcumin, 458-37-7; dystrophin, 116978-02-0; epigallocatechin gallate, 989-51-5; eteplirsen, 1173755-55-9; fish oil, 8016-13-5; glutamine, 56-85-9, 6899-04-3; golodirsen, 1422959-91-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; leucine, 61-90-5, 7005-03-0; melatonin, 73-31-4; prasterone, 53-43-0; resveratrol, 501-36-0; taurine, 107-35-7; ubidecarenone, 303-98-0",,,,"The work has been supported by DPP-NL grant to ADL on pre-clinical assessment of dietary supplement effects in dystrophinopathies and raised in the frame of a task force on dietary issues and nutrition by World Duchenne Organization ( https://www.worldduchenneday.org/category/nutrition-in-dmd/ ).

Objective: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. Design, Settings, and Participants: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. Main Outcomes and Measures: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008).

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results: Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions: HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; QT prolongation; SARS-CoV-2; Torsades de Pointes",,,,,,,,,"Savarino, A., Boelaert, J.R., Cassone, A., Majori, G., Cauda, R., Effects of chloroquine on viral infections: an old drug against today's diseases?

An estimated 798,365 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander were in Australia, 5,2 million indigenous people living in America and 2,13 million in Canada. Racial/ethnic disparities in mental health service use have increased especially in the context of the new coronavirus pandemic. Thus, we aimed to describe the mental health situation of the indigenous population in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Method:: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results:: According to the literature, due to the COVID-19 pandemic there is a lack of specialized mental health services and professionals, a restricted access to quality information and a lack of access to inputs, causing negative feelings and it can exacerbate pre-existing mental problems (eg: depression, suicidal ideation, smoking and binge drink). The cultural differences are a risk factor to worsen the mental health of this already vulnerable population.

Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris","Anxiety; Confinement; Depression; Hallucinations; PTSD",,,,,,,,,"Csikszentmihalyi, M., Vivre : la psychologie du Bonheur (L.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest on a spectrum of illness from mild disease to severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit admission. As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions. There is currently no widely accepted standard of care in the pharmacologic management of patients with COVID-19. Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority. Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immunomodulating therapies. Many have demonstrated in vitro or in vivo potential against other viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 have additional considerations related to adjustments for organ impairment and renal replacement therapies, complex lists of concurrent medications, limitations with drug administration and compatibility, and unique toxicities that should be evaluated when utilizing these therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize practical considerations for pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19, with the intent of serving as a resource for health care providers at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","antivirals;

The mining sector is not immune to these impacts, and the crisis has the potential to have severe consequences in the short, medium and long-term for the industry.

Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method: The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results: According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus infection; Mental health; Refugees","Africa; Asia; Bangladesh; Brazil; catering service; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; counseling; crowding (area); cultural factor; depression; dietary intake; disease course; employment status; epidemic; fear; financial management; France; general practitioner; Germany; government; Greece; health care access; health care cost; health care practice; health care system; health promotion; health service; health status; high risk population; housing; human; infection prevention; infection risk; language ability; Letter; malnutrition; mental disease; mental health; mental health care; Middle East; New York; personal hygiene; population density; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; priority journal; public health service; publication; quarantine; refugee; refugee camp; religion; safety; sanitation; sewage disposal; social distance; volunteer; vulnerable population; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; mental disease; pandemic; psychology; risk factor; uncertainty; virus pneumonia; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Fear; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Refugees; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Uncertainty",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). χ2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Corona Virus Disease 2019; Health care workers; Mental health; Resilience","adult; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Article; chi square test; China; cohort analysis; Connor Davidson resilience scale; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; depression; female; health care personnel; hostility; human; male; medical staff; mental health; multiple regression; obsessive compulsive disorder; paranoia; prevalence; priority journal; professional competence; psychological resilience; psychosis; social support; social support assessment; Social Support Rating Scale; somatization; Student t test; Symptom Checklist 90; work experience",,,,,"17CXZ002

Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method:: The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results:: By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions:: Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Education; Mental Health","coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; distance education; education; human; learning; Letter; mental health; nonhuman; online education; online system; pandemic; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; teaching; adolescent; anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; depression; psychology; SARS coronavirus; student; uncertainty; university; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Education, Distance; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Students; Uncertainty; Universities; Young Adult",,,,,"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq

Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant’s social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. Objectives The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-eKect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. Main results We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no diKerence in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean diKerence (MD) −0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD −0.34, 95% CI −3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD −2.40, 95% CI −7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no diKerence in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI −0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD −0.83, 95% CI −2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small eKect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD −2.04, 95% CI −3.98 to −0.10; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short- Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure diKerent aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no diKerence between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI −5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD −7.66, 95% CI −24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD −7.18, 95% CI −16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI −8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD −3.25, 95% CI −15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD −3.60, 95% CI −9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02) and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI −2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; depression; home for the aged; human; loneliness; meta analysis; nursing home; pandemic; procedures; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); social control; social isolation; virus pneumonia; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Loneliness; Nursing Homes; Online Social Networking; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Social Control, Informal; Social Isolation",,,,,,,,"Tsai, H.H., Tsai, Y.F., Wang, H.H., Chang, Y.C., Chu, H.H., Videoconference program enhances social support, loneliness, and depressive status of elderly nursing home residents (2010) Aging & Mental Health, 14 (8), pp. 947-954; Tsai, H.H., Tsai, Y.F., Changes in depressive symptoms, social support, and loneliness over 1 year after a minimum 3-month videoconference program for older nursing home residents (2011) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 13 (4), pp. 373-384; Tsai, H.H., Cheng, C.Y., Shieh, W.Y., Chang, Y.C., Effects of a smartphone-based videoconferencing program for older nursing home residents on depression, loneliness, and quality of life: A quasi-experimental study (2020) BMC Geriatrics, 20 (1), p. 27; Arthanat, S., Vroman, K., A home-based information communication technology training for older adults: Effectiveness, value, and perspectives (2016) American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 70 (1); Banbury, A., Nancarrow, S., Dart, J., Gray, L., Dodson, S., Osborne, R., Adding value to remote monitoring: Co-design of a health literacy intervention for older people with chronic disease delivered by telehealth-the Telehealth Literacy Project (2020) Patient Education and Counseling, 103 (3), pp. 597-606; Brown, E.V., Remote control training (2007) Health Management Technology, 28 (3), pp. 18-19; Choi, N.G., Pepin, R., Marti, C.N., Stevens, C.J., Bruce, M.L., Improving social connectedness for homebound older adults: Randomized controlled trial of tele-delivered behavioral activation versus tele-delivered friendly visits American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, , (in press); Videoconferencing as a method of treatment delivery for older adults: The effectiveness of a behavioral activation treatment (2012) Clinician's Research Digest: Adult Populations, 30 (1), p. 1. , Clinician's Research Digest; Dowling, G.A., Merrilees, J., Mastick, J., Chang, V.Y., Hubbard, E., Moskowitz, J.T., Life enhancing activities for family caregivers of people with frontotemporal dementia (2014) Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders, 28 (2), pp. 175-181; Elliott, T.R., Brossart, D., Berry, J.W., Fine, P.R., Problem-solving training via videoconferencing for family caregivers of persons with spinal cord injuries: A randomized controlled trial (2008) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 46 (11), pp. 1220-1229; Ferreira, S., Torres, A., Veloso, A., Training effects on older adults in information and communication technologies considering psychosocial variables (2015) Educational Gerontology, 41 (7), pp. 482-493; Fokin, V.A., Fokin, I.V., The possibilities of electronic-social network in services for old citizens (2011) Uspekhi Gerontologii/Advances in Gerontology, 242 (124), pp. 162-167; Hicken, B.L., Daniel, C., Luptak, M., Grant, M., Kilian, S., Rupper, R.W., Supporting caregivers of rural veterans electronically (SCORE) (2017) Journal of Rural Health, 33 (3), pp. 305-313; Hori, M., Kubota, M., Ando, K., Kihara, T., Takahashi, R., Kinoshita, A., The effect of videophone communication (With Skype and webcam) for elderly patients with dementia and their caregivers (2009) Gan to Kagaku Ryoho.

Due to the sudden nature of the outbreak and the infectious power of the virus, it causes people anxiety, depression, and other stress reactions. The prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia have moved into a vital stage. It is essential to early predict and forecast of virus outbreak during this disruptive time to control of its morbidity and mortality. This paper uses an artificial intelligence and deep learning for prediction of coronavirus through time series using Non-Linear Regressive Network (NAR). It can be considered as an effective approach to early warning and to aid politicians. The network is forecasted the coronavirus cases and deaths through nine countries namely; Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United States of America, Spain, Italy, France, Iran, Russian Federation during the period from 23-Mar-2020 to 30-July-2020. All data is collected from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports and the confirmed cases and deaths are considered. It is found that training error in the network prediction which represents its regression and performance is 2.65 % in cases forecast and 3.22 % in deaths forecast for global prediction. © 2020 SERSC.","Artificial intelligence; Coronavirus outbreak; Neural network forecasting; Non-linear autoregressive network; Time series prediction",,,,,,,,,"Hu, Z., yang Ge, Q., Li, S., Jin, L., Xiong, M., (2020) Artificial Intelligence Forecasting of Covid-19 in China, , https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07112, Cornell University; Isaifan, R.J., The dramatic impact of Coronavirus outbreak on air quality: Has it saved as much as it killed so far?

It was a relatively under-explored field, and as a clinical and educational psychologist it was becoming increasingly apparent that there were concerns of young people, with some of these reflected in their experiences of sadness and despair. However, as I researched and measured the depression construct, I became aware of despair as a growing phenomenon, with an increased focus and emphasis on stress, anxiety and depression. In time, the statistics would bear out the concerns, as one in four young people have identified as being or are likely to be depressed in their lifetime in some Western communities like Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom (WHO, 2018). Given the growing 'ill health' of our Western communities, something had to change. In the 1980s, young people were concerned about their future with the fear of nuclear war. As I was writing this invited retrospective in late 2019, there were widespread concerns about global warming, and in the first half of 2020 concerns arising from the pandemic of COVID-19 are dominating. Coping theory research and practice can make a significant contribution to how we cope with our world in general and the specifics of our lives in particular. This article reports a body of work in the field of coping to illustrate the value of the core constructs and their applications in diverse settings providing opportunities for helpful adaptation and development in the face of whatever circumstances arise. © Australian Psychological Society Ltd, 2020.","coping theory; interventions; measurement",,,,,,,,,"Alexander, M.A., (2018) Evaluation of An Explicit Social and Emotional Learning Intervention for Preschool Children: The Impact of Program Facilitation Experience on Outcomes, , [Unpublished master's thesis].

Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased Ih amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in Ih activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ca2+ current; Hyperpolarization-activated cation current; K+ current; Membrane potential; Pirfenidone; Pituitary cell; Voltage hysteresis",,,,,,"D108-F2507

Background: The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. Methods: We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. Results: All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6. ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support. Conclusions: Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients. Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acute coronary syndrome; COVID-19; PCI; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan (2020) China JAMA, 323, p. 1061. , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.1585; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579 (7798), pp. 270-273. , https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report, , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/; Chan, K.S., Zheng, J.P., Mok, Y.W., SARS: prognosis, outcome and sequelae (2003) Respirology, 8, pp. S36-S40. , https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00522.x; Badawi, A., Ryoo, S.G., Prevalence of comorbidities in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) Int J Infect Dis, 49, pp. 129-133. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.06.015; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan (2020) China Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5; Li, B., Yang, J., Zhao, F., Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China (2020) Clin Res Cardiol, 109, pp. 531-538. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-020-01626-9; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., China medical treatment expert Group for Covid-19.

Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6–16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants’ level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (≥7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels ≥7.5 μM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attention; Child development; Choline; Coronavirus; Phosphatidylcholine; Pregnancy","C reactive protein; choline; adult; anxiety; Article; behavior assessment; brain development; child behavior; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; fetus brain; fetus development; Food and Drug Administration; gestational age; human; infant behavior questionnaire; male; newborn; postnatal depression; priority journal; sadness; viral respiratory tract infection",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; choline, 123-41-1, 13232-47-8, 1927-06-6, 4858-96-2, 62-49-7, 67-48-1",,,"Anschutz Foundation

Prior research suggests that SMEs use bricolage to cope with such negative external shocks. While there is a rich discussion on how SMEs carry out their bricolage processes, the literature provides little empirical evidence on what actually happens in times of crisis. To examine whether the SME bricolage process described in the literature is consistent with how SMEs use bricolage when they face a business environment crisis, we conducted a qualitative study of six SMEs’ response to the austerity measures of the bailout programme for Greece, scheduled by the EU, ECB and IMF, which were known to have unambiguously led to the deterioration of the SME business environment. We found that bricolage occurred across all SMEs’ activities as expected. However, contrary to the literature, we found that bricolage did not lead the strategic approach of any of the investigated SMEs. Rather, bricolage was integrated within their overall strategy. Furthermore, we found that how the bricolage is unrolled depends on the SME sector. With this knowledge, the present study suggests policymakers need to adjust their support system towards enabling resource-constrained SMEs to deal with the aftermath of negative shocks in their business environment. © 2020, © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.","bricolage entrepreneurial; crise; crisis; entrepreneurial bricolage; entrepreneuriat; Entrepreneurship; environnement sans ressources; PME; SMEs",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A.R., Ullah, F., The Condition of Smallness: How What It Means to Be Small Deters Firms from Getting Bigger (2014) Management Decision, 52 (2), pp. 326-349; Apostolopoulos, N., Newbery, R., Gkartzios, M., Social Enterprise and Community Resilience: Examining a Greek Response to Turbulent Times (2019) Journal of Rural Studies, 70, pp. 215-224; Ardagna, S., Caselli, F., The Political Economy of the Greek Debt Crisis: A Tale of Two Bailouts (2014) American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 6 (4), pp. 291-323; Bacq, S., Ofstein, L.F., Kickul, J.R., Gundry, L.K., Bricolage in Social Entrepreneurship: How Creative Resource Mobilization Fosters Greater Social Impact (2015) The International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, 16 (4), pp. 283-289; Baker, T., Miner, A.S., Eesley, D.T., Improvising Firms: Bricolage, account Giving and Improvisational Competencies in the Founding Process (2003) Research Policy, 32 (2), pp. 255-276; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating Something from Nothing: Resource Construction through Entrepreneurial Bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366; Balios, D., Daskalakis, N., Eriotis, N., Vasiliou, D., SMEs Capital Structure Determinants during Severe Economic Crisis: The Case of Greece (2016) Cogent Economics & Finance, 4 (1); Bhidé, A., (2000) The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses, , UK: Oxford University Press; Dana, L.P., Dana, T.E., Expanding the Scope of Methodologies Used in Entrepreneurship Research (2005) International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 2 (1), pp. 79-88; Desa, G., Resource Mobilization in International Social Entrepreneurship: Bricolage as a Mechanism of Institutional Transformation (2012) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 36 (4), pp. 727-751; Desa, G., Basu, S., Optimization or Bricolage?
