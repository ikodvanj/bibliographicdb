Further, BCG vaccination is being considered for clinical trials aiming to test its potential for lowering COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This article illustrates some structural and functional relationships that may gather these drugs and the author, basing on a combined pathophysiological and pharmacological approach, recommends the FDA-approved antidiarrhea drug; nitazoxanide, which has been previously suggested but unfortunately widely ignored, to be tested in combination with azithromycin for their potential activity against SARS CoV-2, soonest. The author also recommends testing their combined administration as early during the clinical course of COVID-19 as possible. Further, basing on the same represented concept, the author suggests more trials for interferons to be tested against SARS CoV-2, especially in severe and critical COVID-19 cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Interferons; Nitazoxanide; SARS CoV-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; nitazoxanide; clinical outcome; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug structure; human; immune response; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ivermectin, 70288-86-7; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4",,,,,,"Coscione, S., Esau, T., Kekeubata, E., Impact of ivermectin administered for scabies treatment on the prevalence of head lice in Atoifi, Solomon Islands (2018) PLoS Negl.

There is an urgency of developing a therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of COVID-19. Towards that initiative, potential drugs like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin have been tested by diverse group of researchers worldwide for their potential against novel coronavirus. The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMPα/β1) mediated viral import. Azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base. All the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection. However, their efficacies need to be studied in detail individually and in combination in-vivo in order to combat COVID-19 infection. © 2020","Azithromycin; coronavirus; COVID-19; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; integrase; ivermectin; antiviral activity; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; drug accumulation; drug mechanism; human; innate immunity; malaria; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; prophylaxis; protein processing; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; virus replication",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ivermectin, 70288-86-7",,,,,,"Center, J.H.C.R., https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html; Liu, J., Cao, R., Xu, M., Wang, X., Zhang, H., Hu, H., Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (2020) Cell Discov, 6, p. 16; X, Y., F, Y., M, Z., C, C., B, H., P, N., In vitro antiviral activity and projection of optimized dosing design of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2020) Clin Infect Dis, , ciaa237; Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Meddeb, L., Mailhe, M., Doudier, B., Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, p. n105949; Caly, L., Druce, J.D., Catton, M.G., Jans, D.A., Wagstaff, K.M., The FDA-approved Drug Ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (2020) Antivir Res, p. 104787; Poschet, J.F., Perkett, E.A., Timmins, G.S., Deretic, V., Azithromycin and ciprofloxacin have a chloroquine-like effect on respiratory epithelial cells (2020) bioRxiv, 3 (29); Weniger, H., Review of side effects and toxicity of chloroquine (1979) Bull World Health, 79, p. 906; Fox, R.I., Mechanism of action of hydroxychloroquine as an antirheumatic drug (1993) Semin Arthritis Rheum, 23 (2), pp. 82-91; Chang, T.H., Wang, L.F., Lin, Y.S., Yang, C.S., Yu, C.Y., Lin, Y.L., Hydroxychloroquine activates host antiviral innate immunity (2014) Cytokine, 70 (1), pp. 33-34; Azeem, S., Ashraf, M., Rasheed, M.A., Anjum, A.A., Hameed, R., Evaluation of cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of ivermectin against Newcastle disease virus (2015) Pak J Pharm Sci, 28 (2), pp. 597-602; Mastrangelo, E., Pezzullo, M., De Burghgraeve, T., Kaptein, S., Pastorino, B., Dallmeier, K., Ivermectin is a potent inhibitor of flavivirus replication specifically targeting NS3 helicase activity: new prospects for an old drug (2012) J Antimicrob Chemother, 67 (8), pp. 1884-1894; Götz, V., Magar, L., Dornfeld, D., Giese, S., Pohlmann, A., Höper, D., Influenza A viruses escape from MxA restriction at the expense of efficient nuclear vRNP import (2016) Sci Rep, 6, p. 23138; Lundberg, L., Pinkham, C., Baer, A., Amaya, M., Narayanan, A., Wagstaff, K.M., Nuclear import and export inhibitors alter capsid protein distribution in mammalian cells and reduce Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus replication (2013) Antivir Res, 100 (3), pp. 662-672; Jans, D.A., Martin, A.J., Wagstaff, K.M., Inhibitors of nuclear transport (2019) Curr Opin Cell Biol, 58, pp. 50-60","Choudhary, R.; Department of Biotechnology, Maharishi Markandeshwar (Deemed to be University)India; email: rc_07@live.in",,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,20522975,,,,"English","New Microbes New Infect.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084043752

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in COVID-19 (Coronavirus Infectious Disease-2019). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19. The safety profile of AZ used as an antibacterial agent is well-established.(1) This work assesses published in vitro and clinical evidence for AZ as an agent with antiviral properties. It also provides basic CP information relevant for planning and initiating COVID-19 clinical studies with AZ, summarizes safety data from healthy volunteer studies, and safety and efficacy from Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, including a Phase 2/3 study in pediatric patients following administration of AZ and CQ in combination.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is warranted because both medications cause corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation. Whether QTc duration significantly varies during the day, potentially requiring multiple ECGs, remains to be established. Methods: We performed 12‑lead ECGs and 12‑lead 24-h Holter ECG monitoring in all patients aged <80 years admitted to our medical unit for COVID-19, in oral therapy with hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) and azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for at least 3 days. A group of healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as control. Results: Out of 126 patients, 22 (median age 64, 82% men) met the inclusion criteria. ECG after therapy showed longer QTc-interval than before therapy (450 vs 426 ms, p = .02). Four patients had a QTc ≥ 480 ms: they showed higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (52 vs 30 U/L, p = .03) and alanine aminotransferase (108 vs 33 U/L, p < .01) compared with those with QTc < 480 ms. At 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, 1 COVID-19 patient and no control had ≥1 run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (p = .4). No patients showed “R on T"" premature ventricular beats. Analysis of 24-h QTc dynamics revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher QTc values than controls, with no significant hourly variability. Conclusion: Therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prolongs QTc interval in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with high levels of transaminases. Because QTc duration remains stable during the 24 h, multiple daily ECG are not recommendable. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Sudden death; Ventricular arrhythmia",,,,,,,"the authors would like to thank all patients and nurse staff of the Clinica Medica 3, Azienda Ospedaliera - Universit? di Padova, Italy.

We hypothesize a new mechanism supporting the synergistic interaction between these drugs. Azithromycin is a substrate of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) which is localized in endosomes and lysosomes with a polarized substrate transport from the cell cytosol into the vesicle interior. SARS-CoV-2 and drugs meet in these acidic organelles and both basic drugs, which are potent lysosomotropic compounds, will become protonated and trapped within these vesicles. Consequently, their intra-vesicular concentrations can attain low micromolar effective cytotoxic concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 while concomitantly increase the intra-vesicular pH up to around neutrality. This last effect inhibits lysosomal enzyme activities responsible in virus entry and replication cycle. Based on these considerations, we hypothesize that ABCB1 could be a possible enhancer by confining azithromycin more extensively than expected when the trapping is solely dependent on the passive diffusion. This additional mechanism may therefore explain the synergistic effect when azithromycin is added to hydroxychloroquine, leading to apparently more rapid virus clearance and better clinical benefit, when compared to monotherapy with hydroxychloroquine alone. © 2020, American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.","ABCB1; azithromycin; COVID-19; hydroxychloroquine; lysosomes",,,,,,,,,"Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Hoang, V.T., Meddeb, L., Mailhe, M., Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949; Chen, J., Liu, L., Liu, P., Xu, Q., Xia, L., Ling, Y., Huang, D., Lu, H., A pilot study of hydroxychloroquine in treatment of patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (2020) J Zhejiang Univ (Med Sci), 49 (1); Gao, J., Tian, Z., Yang, X., Breakthrough: chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies (2020) Biosci Trends, 14 (1), pp. 72-73. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXnsFCjt7c%3D, PID: 32074550; Zhou, D., Dai, S.M., Tong, Q., COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing infection and progression (2020) J Antimicrob Chemother, , https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkaa114; Gbinigie, K., Frie, K., Should chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine be used to treat COVID-19?

In our study we determine whether exists differences in cumulative incidence and severity of Covid-19 infection between lung cancer patients visiting our Medical Oncology department and the reference population of our center (320,000 people), in the current epicenter of the pandemic in Europe (Madrid, Spain). We also describe clinical and demographic factors associated with poor prognosis and Covid-19 treatment outcomes. Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1878 medical records of all Covid-19 patients who were admitted at Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor of Madrid between March 5, 2020 and April 7, 2020, in order to detect cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients. We also described Covid-19 treatment outcome, mortality and associated risk factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: 17/1878 total diagnosis in our center had lung cancer (0.9 %) versus 1878/320,000 of the total reference population (p = 0.09). 9/17 lung cancer patients with Covid-19 diagnosis died (52.3 %) versus 192/1878 Covid-19 patients in our center (p < 0.0001). Dead lung cancer patients were elderly compared to survivors: 72 versus 64.5 years old (p = 0.12). Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin improves the outcome of Covid-19 in lung cancer patients, detecting only 1/6 deaths between patients under this treatment versus others treatment, with statistical significance in the univariate and multivariate logistic regression (OR 0.04, p = 0.018). Conclusions: Lung cancer patients have a higher mortality rate than general population. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment seems like a good treatment option. It is important to try to minimize visits to hospitals (without removing their active treatments) in order to decrease nosocomial transmission. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Covid-19; Lung cancer; Mortality; Non-small cell lung cancer; Small cell lung cancer","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; demography; disease severity; disease transmission; female; hospital admission; human; incidence; infection risk; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; mortality rate; outcome assessment; pandemic; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; Spain; very elderly",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5",,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, S0140-6736 (20), pp. 30185-30189. , published online Jan 24; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Early Transmission Dynamics In Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected PneumoniaEarly transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N.

Methods: We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated for at least three days with the following regimen: HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days). Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days). Results: A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years – range 14–95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p <.001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74–95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity of illness at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p <.05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). Conclusion: Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with a very low fatality rate in patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR: 10-IAHU-03

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.","aging; antibiotic; Azithromycin; corona virus; COVID-19; Doxycycline; drug repurposing; Hydroxy-chloroquine; prevention; Quercetin; Rapamycin; senescence; senolytic drug therapy; viral replication","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; azithromycin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl peptidase IV; DPP4 protein, human; hydroxychloroquine; quercetin; virus receptor; age; aged; aging; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; human; metabolism; mortality; pandemic; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Quercetin; Receptors, Virus",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; dipeptidyl peptidase IV, 54249-88-6; hydroxychloroquine, 525-31-5, 118-42-3; quercetin, 117-39-5; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4; DPP4 protein, human; Hydroxychloroquine; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Quercetin; Receptors, Virus",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,19454589,,,"32229706","English","Aging (Albany NY)",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083205359

Methods: We conducted an uncontrolled, non-comparative, observational study in a cohort of 80 relatively mildly infected inpatients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least three days, with three main measurements: clinical outcome, contagiousness as assessed by PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Results: All patients improved clinically except one 86 year-old patient who died, and one 74 year-old patient still in intensive care. A rapid fall of nasopharyngeal viral load was noted, with 83% negative at Day7, and 93% at Day8. Virus cultures from patient respiratory samples were negative in 97.5% of patients at Day5. Consequently patients were able to be rapidly discharged from IDU with a mean length of stay of five days. Conclusion: We believe there is urgency to evaluate the effectiveness of this potentially-life saving therapeutic strategy at a larger scale, both to treat and cure patients at an early stage before irreversible severe respiratory complications take hold and to decrease duration of carriage and avoid the spread of the disease. Furthermore, the cost of treatment is negligible. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Culture; Hydroxychloroquine; PCR; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; virus RNA; azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; adult; aged; Article; blurred vision; clinical classification; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; consciousness level; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease course; drug effect; early warning score; female; follow up; hospital discharge; human; intensive care; length of stay; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nasopharynx; nausea; observational study; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; pilot study; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; thorax radiography; throat culture; upper respiratory tract infection; very elderly; virus culture; virus load; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography; Betacoronavirus; combination drug therapy; Coronavirus infection; France; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; France; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharynx; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Load; Young Adult",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 747-36-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; Azithromycin; Hydroxychloroquine",,,"ANR-10-IAHU-03

The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention. Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described. Collectively, the review provides an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection outbreak along with the recent advancements and strategies for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

Currently, there are no proven effective vaccines or therapeutic agents against the virus. Current clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support. Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anakinra; Azithromycin; Chloroquine; Convalescent plasma; COVID-19; Epoprostenol; Favipiravir; Hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir; Methylprednisolone; Nitric oxide; Oseltamivir; Remdesivir; SAR-CoV-2; Sarilumab; Sirolimus; Tocilizumab; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Umifenovir; Vitamin C",,,,,,"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NCCIH

An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2–5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients. © 2020","Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Hydroxychloroquine; Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; Remdesivir; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)","adenosine phosphate; alanine; amide; antivirus agent; azithromycin; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; lopinavir-ritonavir drug combination; pyrazine derivative; remdesivir; ritonavir; RNA directed RNA polymerase; teicoplanin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug combination; drug effect; human; pandemic; passive immunization; procedures; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Amides; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Combinations; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunization, Passive; Lopinavir; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pyrazines; Ritonavir; RNA Replicase; Teicoplanin",,"adenosine phosphate, 61-19-8, 8063-98-7; alanine, 56-41-7, 6898-94-8; amide, 17655-31-1; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; teicoplanin, 61036-62-2, 61036-64-4; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Amides; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Drug Combinations; favipiravir; Hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir; lopinavir-ritonavir drug combination; Pyrazines; remdesivir; Ritonavir; RNA Replicase; Teicoplanin",,,,,,"Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Fan, G., Liu, Y., Liu, Z., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, , pii: S0140-6736(20)30566-3.

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available. This review summarizes the lessons learnt so far from the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the evidence regarding the drugs that are being tested for the treatment of COVID19, and describes the progress made in efforts to develop an effective vaccine. © 2020 Triggle et al.","COVID-19; Drugs; Vaccines","arbidol; azithromycin; baricitinib; BCG vaccine; beta interferon; celecoxib; chloroquine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; paracetamol; remdesivir; ritonavir; tocilizumab; umifenovir; zanamivir; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug bioavailability; drug development; evidence based medicine; human; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; Short Survey; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; celecoxib, 169590-42-5; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; paracetamol, 103-90-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; umifenovir, 131707-25-0; zanamivir, 139110-80-8; COVID-19 vaccine; Viral Vaccines","arbidol",,,,,"Morens, D.M., Daszak, P., Taubenberger, J.K., Escaping Pandora's box-another novel coronavirus (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1293-1295. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2002106; (2020), https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, Accessed 5 May 2020; (2020) Johns Hopkins University of Medicine Coronavirus Research Center, , https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, Accessed 5 May 2020; (2020) WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dashboard, , https://covid19.who.int/, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland.

Elucidating why some patients suffering from COVID-19 are getting so sick, while others are not, has become an informal imperative for researchers and clinicians around the globe. The answer to this question would allow rationalizing the fear surrounding this pandemic. Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 relies on unraveling of interplaying mechanisms, including SARS-CoV-2 virulence, human immune response, and complex inflammatory reactions with coagulation playing a major role. An interplay with bacterial co-infections, as well as the vascular system and microcirculation affected throughout the body should also be examined. More importantly, a comprehensive understanding of pathological mechanisms of COVID-19 will increase the efficacy of therapy and decrease mortality. Herewith, the authors present a combined viewpoint based on the current state of knowledge on COVID-19: beginning from the virus, its transmission, and mechanisms of entry into the human body, through the pathological effects on the cellular level, up to immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation. Last but not least, currently available and possible future therapeutic and diagnostic options are briefly commented on. © 2020 Via Medica.","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Coagulation; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Immunology; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy","azithromycin; chloroquine; cryopyrin; darunavir; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ritonavir; virus spike protein; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; acute kidney failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; blood clotting; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular system; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disseminated intravascular clotting; human; immunosenescence; inflammation; innate immunity; mixed infection; nonhuman; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; thrombosis; virus entry; virus load; virus replication; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; host pathogen interaction; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; prognosis; severity of illness index; virology; virulence; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Viral Vaccines; Virulence; Virus Internalization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; darunavir, 206361-99-1, 635728-49-3; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ivermectin, 70288-86-7; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; Antiviral Agents; COVID-19 vaccine; Viral Vaccines",,,,,,"Smiatacz, T., It didn’t have to happen this way – what COVID-19 tells us about translational medicine (2020) Eur J Transl Clin Med; Wu, F., Zhao Su, Y.B., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China (2020) Nature, 579 (7798), pp. 265-269. , 32015508; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579 (7798), pp. 270-273; Wang, M., Li, M., Ren, R., International expansion of a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutant (2020) J Virol; Wang, W., Xu, Y., Gao, R., Detection of sars-cov-2 in different types of clinical specimens (2020) JAMA; Lescure, F.X., Bouadma, L., Nguven, D., Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: A case series (2020) Lancet Infect Dis.; Yu, F., Yan, L., Wang, N., Quantitative detection and viral load analysis of sars-cov-2 in infected patients (2020) Clin Infect Dis., , Epub ahead of print, indexed in Pubmed: 32221523; Peng, L., Liu, J., Xu, W., SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in urine, blood, anal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs specimens (2020) J Med Virol., , Epub ahead of print, indexed in Pubmed: 32330305; Paoli, D., Pallotti, F., Colangelo, S., Study of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with positive naso-pharyngeal swab (2020) J Endocrinol Invest, , Epub ahead of print], indexed in Pubmed: 32329026; Kujawski, S.T.C., COVID-19 Investigation Team.

We determine whether differences exist in cumulative incidence and mortality of Covid-19 infection between cancer patients and general population in Madrid. Material and methods: We reviewed 1069 medical records of all cancer patients admitted at Oncology department between Feb 1 and April 7, 2020. We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors. Results: We detected 45/1069 Covid-19 diagnoses in cancer patients vs 42,450/6,662,000 in total population (p < 0.00001). Mortality rate: 19/45 cancer patients vs 5586/42,450 (p = 0.0001). Mortality was associated with older median age, adjusted by staging and histology (74 vs 63.5 years old, OR 1.06, p = 0.03). Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Cancer patients are vulnerable to Covid-19 with an increase in complications. Combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is presented as a good treatment option. © 2020, Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO).","Cancer; Covid-19; Cumulative incidence; Metastatic; Mortality",,,,,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet., 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1199-1207. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXmt1Whtrw%3D; Yin, Y., Wunderink, R.G., MERS, SARS and other coronaviruses as causes of pneumonia (2018) Respirology, 23 (2), pp. 130-137; Conti, P., Ronconi, G., Caraffa, A., Induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) and lung inflammation by Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19 or SARS-CoV-2): anti-inflammatory strategies (2020) J Biol Regul Homeost Agents, 34 (2), p. 1; Cortiula, F., Pettke, A., Bastoletti, M., Managing COVID-19 in the oncology clinic and avoiding the distraction effect (2020) Ann Oncol., 31 (5), pp. 553-555; Curigliano, G., How to guarantee the best of care to patients with cancer during the COVID-19 epidemic: the Italian experience (2020) Oncologist.; Yu, J., Ouyang, W., Chua, M.L.K., SARS-CoV-2 transmission in patients with cancer at a tertiary care hospital in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Oncol.; Zhang, L., Zhu, F., Xie, C., Clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients: a retrospective case study in three hospitals within Wuhan, China (2020) Ann.

Presently, no approved treatment or prophylaxis is available for COVID-19. We comment on the existing COVID-19 research methodologies in general and the published reporting. Given the media attention and claims of effectiveness, we chose chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, in combination with azithromycin, as an area of COVID-19 research to examine. Methods/Study Design and Setting: MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were searched from 2019 to present (April 3rd, 2020) using a mix of keywords such as COVID-19 and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We also searched the largest clinical medicine preprint repository, medRxiv.org. Results: We found 6 studies, 3 randomized control trials and 3 observational studies, focusing on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (with azithromycin). We critically appraised the evidence. Conclusion: We found that the COVID-19 research methodology is very poor in the area of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine research. In screening the literature, we observed the same across COVID-19 research in relation to potential treatments. The reporting is very poor and sparse, and patient-important outcomes needed to discern decision-making priorities are not reported. We do understand the barriers to perform rigorous research in health care settings overwhelmed by a novel deadly disease. However, this emergency pandemic situation does not transform flawed methods and data into credible results. The adequately powered, comparative, and robust clinical research that is needed for optimal evidence-informed decision-making remains absent in COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bias; Chloroquine; Clinical trial; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine",,,,,,,,,"Colson, P., Rolain, J.M., Lagier, J.C., Brouqui, P., Raoult, D., Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as available weapons to fight COVID-19 (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents, 55, p. 105932; Gao, J., Tian, Z., Yang, X., Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies (2020) Biosci Trends, 14, pp. 72-73; Chen, J., Liu, D., Liu, L., Liu, P., Xu, Q., Xia, L., A pilot study of hydroxychloroquine in treatment of patients with common coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (2020) J Zhejiang Univ (Med Sci), 49 (1); Chen, Z., Hu, Z., Zhang, Z., Jiang, S., Han, S., Yan, D., Efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial (2020), [Pre-publication.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, randomised, Placebo-controlled, 2-arm ratio 1:1, parallel group double-blind study. PARTICIPANTS: 226 participants are recruited at the trial sites/hospitals, where the study will take place in Denmark: Aalborg, Bispebjerg, Gentofte, Herlev, Hillerød, Hvidovre, Odense and Slagelse hospitals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: • Patient admitted to Danish emergency departments, respiratory medicine departments or internal medicine departments • Age≥ 18 years • Hospitalized ≤48 hours • Positive COVID-19 test / diagnosis during the hospitalization (confirmed). • Men or non-fertile women. Fertile women* must not be pregnant, i.e. negative pregnancy test must be available at inclusion • Informed consent signed by the patient *Defined as after menarche and until postmenopausal (no menstruation for 12 months) Exclusion criteria: • At the time of recruitment, the patient uses >5 LO2/min (equivalent to 40% FiO2 if measured) • Known intolerance/allergy to azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine or hypersensitivity to quinine or 4-aminoquinoline derivatives • Neurogenic hearing loss • Psoriasis • Retinopathy • Maculopathy • Visual field changes • Breastfeeding • Severe liver diseases other than amoebiasis (INR> 1.5 spontaneously) • Severe gastrointestinal, neurological and hematological disorders (investigator-assessed) • eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 • Clinically significant cardiac conduction disorders/arrhythmias or prolonged QTc interval (QTc (f) of> 480/470 ms). • Myasthenia gravis • Treatment with digoxin* • Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency • Porphyria • Hypoglycaemia (Blood glucose at any time since hospitalization of <3.0 mmol/L) • Severe mental illness which significantly impedes cooperation • Severe linguistic problems that significantly hinder cooperation • Treatment with ergot alkaloids *The patient must not be treated with digoxin for the duration of the intervention. For atrial fibrillation/flutter, select according to the Cardiovascular National Treatment Guide (NBV): Calcium antagonist, Beta blocker, direct current (DC) conversion or amiodarone. In case of urgent need for digoxin treatment (contraindication for the aforementioned equal alternatives), the test drug should be paused, and ECG should be taken daily. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control group: The control group will receive the standard treatment + placebo for both types of intervention medication at all times. If part or all the intervention therapy being investigated becomes standard treatment during the study, this may also be offered to the control group. Intervention group: The patients in the intervention group will also receive standard care. Immediately after randomisation to the intervention group, the patient will begin treatment with: Azithromycin: Day 1-3: 500 mg x 1 Day 4-15: 250 mg x 1 If the patient is unable to take the medication orally by themselves, the medication will, if possible, be administered by either stomach-feeding tube, or alternatively, temporary be changed to clarithromycin 500 mg x 2 (this only in agreement with either study coordinator Pradeesh Sivapalan or principal investigator Jens-Ulrik Stæhr Jensen). This will also be done in the control group if necessary. The patient will switch back to azithromycin when possible. Hydroxychloroquine: Furthermore, the patient will be treated with hydroxychloroquine as follows: Day 1-15: 200 mg x 2 MAIN OUTCOMES: • Number of days alive and discharged from hospital within 14 days (summarises both whether the patient is alive and discharged from hospital) (""Days alive and out of hospital"") RANDOMISATION: The sponsor (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Trial Network, COP:TRIN) generates a randomisation sequence. Randomisation will be in blocks of unknown size and the final allocation will be via an encrypted website (REDCap). There will be stratification for age (>70 years vs. <=70 years), site of recruitment and whether the patient has any of the following chronic lung diseases: COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease (Yes vs. No). BLINDING (MASKING): Participants and study personnel will both be blinded, i.e. neither will know which group the participant is allocated to. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This study requires 226 patients randomised 1:1 with 113 in each group. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.8, from April 16, 2020. Recruitment is ongoing (first patient recruited April 6, 2020; final patient expected to be recruited October 31, 2020). TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04322396 (registered March 26, 2020) FULL PROTOCOL: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical management; COVID-19; Environmental effect; Pandemic; Social distancing; Social lockdown","Health care; Azithromycin; CO2 emissions; Coronaviruses; Global index; Health-care system; Infection rates; Preventive measures; Self regeneration; Cobalt alloys; alcohol; azithromycin; carbon dioxide; chloroquine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; nitrogen dioxide; remdesivir; ritonavir; soap; tocilizumab; COVID-19; disease control; health care; hygiene; infectious disease; lifestyle; respiratory disease; viral disease; antiviral therapy; Bangladesh; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cost of illness; disease transmission; dynamics; environmental factor; environmental impact; France; geographic distribution; hand washing; human; India; infection control; infection prevention; infection rate; Italy; lifestyle; medical care; medication therapy management; Pakistan; priority journal; Review; social isolation; social lockdown; Spain; Sri Lanka; Switzerland; virus virulence; India; Coronavirus",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: 01.03.17, 1188/ST

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation","anticoagulant; antiplatelet; antithrombotic therapy; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; thrombosis","anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; antivitamin K; azithromycin; chloroquine; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; methylprednisolone; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; acute coronary syndrome; artery thrombosis; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; disease transmission; follow up; health care organization; health care personnel; health care system; heart muscle injury; hematological parameters; hemostasis; human; incidence; infection risk; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; public health; Review; thromboembolism; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; virus transmission",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,"The authors thank Kathryn Mikkelsen, MBA, from the North American Thrombosis Forum, and Adriana Vison?, MD, from the European Society of Vascular Medicine for their comments related to this initiative.

The working group ‘Drugs and COVID-19’ was composed of a scientific council, an editorial team, and experts in the field. The first questions were posted online during the first evening of home-confinement in France, March 17, 2020. Six weeks later, 140 Q&As have been posted. Questions on the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine and to a lesser extent concerning azithromycin have been the most consulted Q&As. Q&As have been consulted 226 014 times in 41 days. This large visibility was obtained through an early communication on Twitter, Facebook, traditional print, and web media. In addition, an early communication through the French Ministry of Health and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety ANSM had a large impact in terms of daily number of views. There is a pressing need to sustain a public drug information service combining the expertise of scholarly pharmacology societies, pharmacovigilance network, and the Ministry of Health to quickly provide understandable, clear, expert answers to the general population’s concerns regarding COVID-19 and drug use and to counter fake news. © 2020 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique","COVID-19; pharmacology; public drug information; public health","antihistaminic agent; azithromycin; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; mouthwash; povidone iodine; allergic asthma; allergy; Article; asthma; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; disinformation; drug information; France; human; Internet; oropharynx; pandemic; priority journal; public health service; publication; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social media; Betacoronavirus; consumer health information; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug information; health care organization; organization and management; procedures; public health; social network; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Consumer Health Information; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Information Services; France; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Social Networking; Societies, Pharmaceutical",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; povidone iodine, 25655-41-8",,,"Agence Nationale de SÃ©curitÃ© du MÃ©dicament et des Produits de SantÃ©, ANSM","We thank Alain Eschalier, professor emeritus of pharmacology at Clermont-Ferrand, for proofreading Q&As on the website.

Method: A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. Results: There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57 ± 21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNFα inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% Conclusion: Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNFα antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease. Further study is warranted. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biologics; COVID-19; DMARDs; Rheumatic disease; SARS CoV-2","adalimumab; amlodipine; azithromycin; canakinumab; cotrimoxazole; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; famotidine; hydrochlorothiazide; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; levothyroxine; losartan; methotrexate; metoprolol; mycophenolate mofetil; nortriptyline; olmesartan; omeprazole; oxygen; prednisone; rituximab; rosuvastatin; secukinumab; steroid; tamsulosin; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; unindexed drug; adult; African American; aged; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; artificial ventilation; case report; case study; Caucasian; clinical article; clinical feature; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; hemodialysis; Hispanic; hospital discharge; human; human cell; immunosuppressive treatment; length of stay; lupus erythematosus nephritis; lymphocyte count; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; mortality; nose smear; outcome assessment; oxygen therapy; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; spondyloarthropathy; systemic lupus erythematosus; tachycardia; thorax radiography; throat culture; tracheostomy; treatment duration; virus pneumonia; Wegener granulomatosis",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; amlodipine, 88150-42-9; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; canakinumab, 402710-25-2, 402710-27-4, 914613-48-2; cotrimoxazole, 8064-90-2; etanercept, 185243-69-0, 200013-86-1, 2055118-96-0; famotidine, 76824-35-6; hydrochlorothiazide, 58-93-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; levothyroxine, 51-48-9; losartan, 114798-26-4; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; metoprolol, 37350-58-6; mycophenolate mofetil, 116680-01-4, 128794-94-5; nortriptyline, 72-69-5, 894-71-3; olmesartan, 144689-63-4; omeprazole, 73590-58-6, 95510-70-6; oxygen, 7782-44-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; rituximab, 174722-31-7; rosuvastatin, 147098-18-8, 147098-20-2; secukinumab, 875356-43-7, 875356-44-8; tamsulosin, 106133-20-4, 106138-88-9, 106463-17-6, 80223-99-0, 94666-07-6; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9","Viracor Eurofins, Lee, United States","Lee, United States",,,,"Duret, P.M., Sebbag, E., Mallick, A., Gravier, S., Spielmann, L., Messer, L., Recovery from COVID-19 in a patient with spondyloarthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , pii: annrheumdis-2020-217362[Epub ahead of print]; Guilpain, P., Le Bihan, C., Foulongne, V., Taourel, P., Pansu, N., Maria, A.T.J., Rituximab for granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the pandemic of covid-19: lessons from a case with severe pneumonia (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , Ann Rheum Dis. 2020 Apr 20. pii: annrheumdis-2020-217549[Epub ahead of print]; Mihai, C., Dobrota, R., Schroder, M., Garaiman, A., Jordan, S., Becker, M.O., COVID-19 in a patient with systemic sclerosis treated with tocilizumab for SSc-ILD (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, 79 (5), pp. 668-669. , Epub 2020 Apr 2; Moutsopoulos, H.M., Anti-inflammatory therapy may ameliorate the clinical picture of COVID-19 (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , pii: annrheumdis-2020-217562[Epub ahead of print]; Favalli, E.G., Ingegnoli, F., Cimaz, R., Caporali, R., What is the true incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases?

In this special context, the French Rare Health Care for Neuromuscular Diseases Network (FILNEMUS) has established guidance in an attempt to homogenize the management of neuromuscular (NM) patients within the French territory. Hospitalization should be reserved for emergencies, the conduct of treatments that cannot be postponed, check-ups for which the diagnostic delay may result in a loss of survival chance, and cardiorespiratory assessments for which the delay could be detrimental to the patient. A national strategy was adopted during a period of 1 to 2 months concerning treatments usually administered in hospitalization. NM patients treated with steroid/immunosuppressants for a dysimmune pathology should continue all of their treatments in the absence of any manifestations suggestive of COVID-19. A frequently asked questions (FAQ) sheet has been compiled and updated on the FILNEMUS website. Various support systems for self-rehabilitation and guided exercises have been also provided on the website. In the context of NM diseases, particular attention must be paid to two experimental COVID-19 treatments, hydroxycholoroquine and azithromycin: risk of exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and QT prolongation in patients with pre-existing cardiac involvement. The unfavorable emergency context related to COVID-19 may specially affect the potential for intensive care admission (ICU) for people with NMD. In order to preserve the fairest medical decision, a multidisciplinary working group has listed the neuromuscular diseases with a good prognosis, usually eligible for resuscitation admission in ICU and, for other NM conditions, the positive criteria suggesting a good prognosis. Adaptation of the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) make it possible to limit nebulization and continue using NIV in ventilator-dependent patients. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Guidelines; Management; Neuromuscular; Treatment","alpha glucosidase; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiinfective agent; antimalarial agent; azithromycin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; GAA protein, human; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunosuppressive agent; nusinersen; oligonucleotide; patisiran; small interfering RNA; steroid; Betacoronavirus; cardiorespiratory fitness; Coronavirus infection; emergency treatment; France; glycogen storage disease type 2; hospitalization; human; immunopathology; neuromuscular disease; pandemic; physiotherapy; practice guideline; prognosis; spinal muscular atrophy; treatment withdrawal; virus pneumonia; alpha-Glucosidases; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimalarials; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Treatment; France; Glycogen Storage Disease Type II; Hospitalization; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immune System Diseases; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Immunosuppressive Agents; Muscular Atrophy, Spinal; Neuromuscular Diseases; Oligonucleotides; Pandemics; Physical Therapy Modalities; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; RNA, Small Interfering; Steroids; Withholding Treatment",,"alpha glucosidase, 9001-42-7; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; nusinersen, 1258984-36-9; patisiran, 1420706-45-1; alpha-Glucosidases; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimalarials; Azithromycin; GAA protein, human; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Immunosuppressive Agents; nusinersen; Oligonucleotides; patisiran; RNA, Small Interfering; Steroids",,,,,,"Agence Régionale de Santé Île-de-France, Recommandation régionales COVID-19 (2020), https://www.iledefrance.ars.sante.fr/system/files/2020-04/Covid19-Neurologie-18-Recommandations-ARSIDF.pdf; Lurie, N., Carr, B.G., The role of telehealth in the medical response to disasters (2018) JAMA Intern Med, 178, pp. 745-746; Wechsler, L.R., Advantages and limitations of teleneurology (2015) JAMA Neurol, 72, pp. 349-354; Vry, J., Gramsch, K., Rodger, S., Thompson, R., Steffensen, B.F., Rahbek, J., European cross-sectional survey of current care practices for Duchenne muscular dystrophy reveals regional and age-dependent differences (2016) J Neuromuscul Dis, 3, pp. 517-527; Kang, P.B., Morrison, L., Iannaccone, S.T., Graham, R.J., Bönnemann, C.G., Rutkowski, A., Evidence-based guideline summary: evaluation, diagnosis, and management of congenital muscular dystrophy: report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Issues Review Panel of the American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (2015) Neurology, 84, pp. 1369-1378; Andrews, J.G., Conway, K., Westfield, C., Trout, C., Meaney, F.J., Mathews, K., Implementation of Duchenne muscular dystrophy care considerations (2018) Pediatrics, 142; Apkon, S.D., Alman, B., Birnkrant, D.J., Fitch, R., Lark, R., Mackenzie, W., Orthopedic and surgical management of the patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (2018) Pediatrics, 142, pp. S82-S89; Voet, N.B., van der Kooi, E.L., van Engelen, B.G., Geurts, A.C., Strength training and aerobic exercise training for muscle disease (2019) Cochrane Database Syst Rev, 12, p.

In late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of uncertain etiology happened in Wuhan, China. There were many reports related to a live-animal and seafood market, supporting that the pathogens were transferred from animals to humans, rapidly evolving into transmission from human to human. The pathogen was classified as 2019 Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV), and the disease was named COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given that COVID-19 has lately been detected in infected patients’ saliva, the COVID-19 outbreak is an alert that all dental and other health professionals must be vigilant in defending against the infectious disease spread, and it may enable to assess whether non-invasive saliva diagnostic for COVID-19. There has so far been no evidence from randomized controlled trials to prescribe any particular anti-nCoV treatment or vaccine, and COVID-19 management has been widely supportive. Since the ACE-2 was expressing on oral cavity mucosa, there is a potentially huge COVID-19 infectious vulnerability risk for oral cavity and brought up a proof for the future prevention procedure in dental practice and daily life. As a result, the whole dental teams should be vigilant and keep patients and themselves in a safe environment by following the guideline in this study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Dentistry; Epidemiology; Infection control","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; virus vaccine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; aerosol; clinical feature; cone beam computed tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; dental procedure; dentist; disease transmission; disinfection; hand washing; human; humidity; incubation time; infection prevention; nonhuman; panoramic radiography; patient care; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; surface property; temperature; vaccination; waste disposal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; metabolism; mouth mucosa; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dentists; Mouth Mucosa; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",,,,,,"Ge, Z.Y., Yang, L.M., Xia, J.J., Fu, X.H., Zhang, Y.Z., Possible aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and special precautions in dentistry (2020) J.

We searched the databases to include randomized and observational studies evaluating the effect of Hydroxychloroquine on mortality in COVID-19 patients. The outcome was summarized as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).We used the inverse-variance method with a random effect model and assessed the heterogeneity using I2 test. We used ROBINS-I tool to assess methodological quality of the included studies. We performed the meta-analysis using ‘Review manager software version 5.3’. We identified 6 observationalstudies satisfying the selection criteria. In all studies, Hydroxychloroquine was given as add on to the standard care and effect was compared with the standard care alone. A pooled analysis observed 251 deaths in 1331 participants of the Hydroxychloroquine arm and 363 deaths in 1577 participants of the control arm. There was no difference in odds of mortality events amongst Hydroxychloroquine and supportive care arm [1.25 (95% CI: 0.65, 2.38); I2 = 80%]. A similar trend was observed with moderate risk of bias studies [0.95 (95% CI: 0.44, 2.06); I2 = 85%]. The odds of mortality were significantly higher in patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin than supportive care alone [2.34 (95% CI: 1.63, 3.34); I2 = 0%]. A pooled analysis of recently published studies suggests no additional benefit for reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients when Hydroxychloroquine is given as add-on to the standard care.

The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. © TÜBİTAK.","COVID-19; Novel corona virus; Pediatrics","alpha2b interferon; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; C reactive protein; favipiravir; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; procalcitonin; remdesivir; tocilizumab; antivirus agent; artificial ventilation; child; computer assisted tomography; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; hospitalization; human; influenza; mortality rate; oxygen therapy; pandemic; pathogenesis; pediatric patient; plasma transfusion; pleura effusion; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; positive end expiratory pressure; respiratory distress; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus transmission; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infant; laboratory technique; newborn; pathophysiology; pediatrics; preschool child; respiratory care; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pediatrics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Therapy; Risk Factors",,"alpha2b interferon, 99210-65-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antiviral Agents",,,,,,"Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (13), pp. 1199-1207; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Dong, Y., Mo, X., Hu, Y., Qi, X., Jiang, F., Epidemiology of COVID-19 among children In China (2020) Pediatrics; Stoecklin, B.S., Rolland, P., Silue, Y., Mailles, A., Campese, C., (2020) Eurosurveillance; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., To, K.K., Chu, H., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 514-523; Chen, Z., Fu, J., Shu, Q., Chen, Y., Hua, C., Diagnosis and treatment recommendations for pediatric respiratory infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2020) World Journal of Pediatrics; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Coronavirus Investigating, and Research Team.

However, there are limited data on efficacy and associated adverse events. Objective: To describe the association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and clinical outcomes among hospital inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients from a random sample of all admitted patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in 25 hospitals, representing 88.2% of patients with COVID-19 in the New York metropolitan region. Eligible patients were admitted for at least 24 hours between March 15 and 28, 2020. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and adverse events were abstracted from medical records. The date of final follow-up was April 24, 2020. Exposures: Receipt of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, or neither. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram findings (arrhythmia or QT prolongation). Results: Among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (858 [59.7%] male, median age, 63 years), those receiving hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both were more likely than those not receiving either drug to have diabetes, respiratory rate &gt;22/min, abnormal chest imaging findings, O2 saturation lower than 90%, and aspartate aminotransferase greater than 40 U/L. Overall in-hospital mortality was 20.3% (95% CI, 18.2%-22.4%). The probability of death for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin was 189/735 (25.7% [95% CI, 22.3%-28.9%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 54/271 (19.9% [95% CI, 15.2%-24.7%]), azithromycin alone, 21/211 (10.0% [95% CI, 5.9%-14.0%]), and neither drug, 28/221 (12.7% [95% CI, 8.3%-17.1%]). In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, compared with patients receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 0.76-2.40]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.63-1.85]), or azithromycin alone (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.26-1.21]). In logistic models, compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin (adjusted OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.12-4.05]), but not hydroxychloroquine alone (adjusted OR, 1.91 [95% CI, 0.96-3.81]) or azithromycin alone (adjusted OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.27-1.56]), In adjusted logistic regression models, there were no significant differences in the relative likelihood of abnormal electrocardiogram findings. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality. However, the interpretation of these findings may be limited by the observational design.. © 2020 American Medical Association.

This group of patients suffers from different opportunistic infections which may coexist with COVID-19. Currently available expert opinions suggest reduction of immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with either antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Inspired by our experience in treatment of CMV pneumonia and literature data on the potential benefit of convalescent plasma for treatment of different viral diseases we suggest use of the hyperimmune anti-CMV gamma globulins in addition to other available therapies. Besides the immunosuppression reduction which is supposed to be beneficial, immunoglobulins with their immunomodulatory effects and possible antiviral role, may increase a possibility for favorable outcome. © 2020","COVID-19; Hyperimmune anti-CMV globulin; Renal transplantation; SARS-CoV-2","globulin; hyperimmune anti CMV gamma globulin; immunoglobulin; unclassified drug; antiviral therapy; convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; human; immunomodulation; infection rate; infection risk; Letter; mortality rate; mortality risk; pandemic; plasma; therapy effect; viremia; virus pneumonia",,"immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4",,,,,,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/; Biotest, A.G., https://www.biotest.com/de/de/produkte/klinische_immunologie/cytotect_cp/produktprofil. cfm, Internal report.

The challenges are not only limited to its preventive strategies, but also extend to curative treatment, and are amplified during the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Older persons with comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, hepatic impairment, renal disorders and respiratory pathologies or immune impairing conditions are more vulnerable and have a higher mortality from COVID-19. Earlier, the Indian Resuscitation Council (IRC) had proposed the Comprehensive Cardiopulmonary Life Support (CCLS) for management of cardiac arrest victims in the hospital setting. However, in patients with COVID-19, the guidelines need to be modified,due to various concerns like differing etiology of cardiac arrest, virulence of the virus, risk of its transmission to rescuers, and the need to avoid or minimize aerosolization from the patient due to various interventions. There is limited evidence in these patients, as the SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection and not much literature is available with high-level evidence related to CPR in patients of COVID-19. These suggested guidelines are a continuum of CCLS guidelines by IRC with an emphasis on the various challenges and concerns being faced during the resuscitative management of COVID-19 patients with cardiopulmonary arrest. © 2020 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Airway management; breathing; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; chest compression; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; magnesium; aerosol; airway pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; cardiopulmonary arrest; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; defibrillation; electrolyte disturbance; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; endotracheal intubation; health care personnel; heart arrest; heart rhythm; human; hypotension; hypoxemia; intensive care; laryngoscopy; medical device contamination; oxygen saturation; positive end expiratory pressure; practice guideline; pulse oximetry; resuscitation; return of spontaneous circulation; torsade des pointes; virus transmission",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; magnesium, 7439-95-4",,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Xingwang, L., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Eng J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Zhu, F., Liu, X., Zhang, J., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA, 323, pp. 1061-1069; Gupta, N., Agarwal, S., Ish, P., Mishra, S., Gaind, R., Usha, G., Clinical and epidemiologicalprofile of the initial COVID-19 patients of a tertiary care centre in India (2020) Monaldi Arch Chest Dis, 90, pp. 193-196; Chow, J., Alhussaini, A., Calvillo-Arguelles, O., Billia, F., Luk, A., Cardiovascular collapse in COVID-19 infection: The Role of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) (2020) CJC Open, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.04.003, [Last cited on 2020 Apr 30]; Garg, R., Ahmed, S.M., Kapoor, M.C., Rao, S.C., Mishra, B.B., Kalandoor, M.V., Comprehensive cardiopulmonary life support (CCLS) by trained paramedics and medics inside the hospital (2017) Indian J Anaesth, 61, pp. 883-894; Ahmed, S.M., Garg, R., Divatia, J.V., Rao, S.C., Mishra, B.B., Kalandoor, M.V., Compression-only life support (COLS) for cardiopulmonary resuscitation by lay person outside the hospital (2017) Indian J Anaesth, 61, pp. 867-873; Garg, R., Ahmed, S.M., Kapoor, M.C., Mishra, B.B., Rao, S.C., Kalandoor, M.V., Basic cardiopulmonary life support (BCLS) by trained paramedics and medics outside the hospital (2017) Indian J Anaesth, 61, pp. 874-882; Edelson, D.P., Sasson, C., Chan, P.S., Atkins, D.L., Aziz, K., Becker, L.B., Interim Guidance for Basic and Advanced Life Support in Adults, Children, and Neonates with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 (2020) Circulation, , https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047463.[Cited2020Apr30]; Tan, W., Aboulhosn, J., The cardiovascular burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with focus on congenital heart disease (2020) Int J Cardiol, 309, pp. 70-77; Yao, W., Wang, T., Jiang, B., Gao, F., Wang, L., Zheng, H., Emergency tracheal intubation in 202 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: Lessons learnt and international expert recommendations (2020) Br J Anaesth, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.026, [Last cited on 2020 Apr 30]; Shao, F., Xu, S., Ma, X., Xu, Z., Lyu, J., Ng, M., In-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) Resuscitation, 151, pp. 18-23; Mercuro, N.J., Yen, C.F., Shim, D.J., Maher, T.R., McCoy, C.M., Zimetbaum, P.J., Risk of QT interval prolongation associated with use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin among hospitalized patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) JAMA Cardiol, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834, [Last cited on 2020 Apr 30]; Thomas, S.H.L., Behr ER.

Currently, thousands of new COVID-19 patients are quickly enrolled in clinical studies. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of the COVID-19 studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and report the extent to which they have incorporated features that are desirable for generating high-quality evidence. On April 28, 2020, a total of 945 studies on COVID-19 have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov; 586 studies are interventional (62.0%), the most frequent allocation scheme is the parallel group assignment (437; 74.6%), they are open-label and the most common primary purpose is the research on treatment. Too many of the ongoing interventional studies have a small expected sample size and may not generate credible evidence at completion. This might lead to a delayed recognition of effective therapies that are urgently needed, and a waste of time and resources. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, it is crucial that the adoption of new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies is based upon evidence coming from well-designed, adequately powered and carefully conducted clinical trials. © 2020 Piovani D et al.","2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","alpha interferon; azithromycin; beta interferon; camostat; chloroquine; favipiravir; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nitazoxanide; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; tocilizumab; Article; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; disease registry; human; infection prevention; pandemic; sample size; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; medical research; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomedical Research; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat, 59721-28-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Sanders, J.M., Monogue, M.L., Jodlowski, T.Z., Pharmacologic Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review (2020) JAMA, , 32282022; ClinicalTrials.gov , p. 2020. , Reference Source; Moher, D., CONSORT: an evolving tool to help improve the quality of reports of randomized controlled trials.

Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting. The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.","adverse effects; arrhythmias; cardiac; COVID-19; drugs; treatment",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,20488734,,,"32372695","English","Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616637

He had visited a hospital for fever and cough and been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia in the right upper lobe. However, he gradually progressed to dyspnea and consulted our hospital. His chest radiographs showed bilateral pneumonia shadows and his CT showed ground glass opacities and consolidation. Although we treated him with broad-spectrum antibiotics, the pneumonia shadow rapidly progressed and mechanical ventilation was administered. We collected sputum from the bronchus using bronchoscopy to detect microorganisms, and RT-PCR tests confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. He was transferred to a designated hospital. In order to prevent the occurrence of nosocomial infections, close contacts within the hospital and medical staff were suspended from their work for two weeks.

The aminoglycosides were proved to have defensin mediated antiviral activity, that could enhance the immunity.

According to the WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), currently there are no medicines or vaccines that have been claimed to be useful in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Several existing antiviral drugs, previously developed or used as treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, are being investigated as COVID-19 treatments and some of them are being used in clinical trials. According to the CDC and Chinese treatment guidelines for COVID-19, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and one of the investigational agents (remdesivir) are recommended in critically ill older patients. The use of other potential drugs reported in different studies may be considered if treatment with first-line drugs is ineffective. There are currently no complete data available from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to provide clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all of the trial drugs for prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19. Until now, it is still unclear which drug can successfully fight against the disease. Therefore, for the better safety of patients with COVID-19, further clinical trials and large randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the effective role, safety profile, and adverse effects of all the potential drugs. Such a measure requires action at the global level. © 2020, The Author(s).","Adverse effects; China; Chloroquine; Coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19); Drugs; MERS; SARS; Therapy","azithromycin;

CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells. Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair. Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anti-viral responses; Asthma; Basigin; Cellular therapy; Coronavirus; Diabetes mellitus; EMMPRIN; Invasion; Lung stem cells; SARS-CoV-2","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; CD147 antigen; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antiinfective agent; azithromycin; BSG protein, human; CD147 antigen; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; protein binding; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; angiogenesis; Article; bronchus epithelium; cell differentiation; cell invasion; cell proliferation; cell therapy; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epithelium hyperplasia; human; immunoprecipitation; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammation; lung fibrosis; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phenotype; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stem cell; tissue regeneration; upregulation; virus load; virus release; virus replication; B lymphocyte; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; drug effect; gene expression; genetics; host pathogen interaction; immunology; lung; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; stem cell; stem cell transplantation; T lymphocyte; virology; virus pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azithromycin; B-Lymphocytes; Basigin; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Gene Expression; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Stem Cell Transplantation; Stem Cells; T-Lymphocytes; Viral Load",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Azithromycin; Basigin; BSG protein, human; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2",,,"FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP

Therefore, the repurposing of existing drugs for new indications is needed.

Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 10 patients ≥60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported. Results: Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients – including the patients who presented with hypoxia – subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization. © 2020 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Hip fracture; Morbidity; Mortality; Pandemic","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; oxygen; aged; Article; asymptomatic infection; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; death; disease severity; female; hemiarthroplasty; hip fracture; hip surgery; hospital admission; human; hypoxia; intramedullary nailing; length of stay; male; New York; osteosynthesis; oxygen consumption; oxygen therapy; postoperative period; priority journal; respiratory failure; retrospective study; thorax radiography; total hip replacement; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; very elderly",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7",,"DePuy Synthes, United States",,,,"De Filippo, O., D'Ascenzo, F., Angelini, F., Reduced rate of hospital admissions for ACS during Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy (2020) N Engl J Med, , Epub ahead of print, NEJMc2009166; Vidal, E.I.O., Moreira-Filho, D.C., Pinheiro, R.S., Delay from fracture to hospital admission: a new risk factor for hip fracture mortality?

Despite the high prevalence of the disease, it has currently no definitive treatment. We here reported the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in severely ill COVID-19 patients diagnosed based on PCR and radiology tests. Case presentation: Five severely ill COVID-19 patients in whom standard treatments failed were administrated with IVIG which prevented the deterioration of clinical symptoms. All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3–0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. Conclusion: Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3–0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Improvement; IVIG","azithromycin; ceftriaxone; hydroxychloroquine; imipenem; immunoglobulin; levofloxacin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; meropenem; oseltamivir; oxygen; vancomycin; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; deterioration; disease course; disease severity; drug megadose; female; high resolution computer tomography; hospital acquired pneumonia; hospital discharge; human; lack of drug effect; male; middle aged; nose smear; oxygen saturation; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thorax radiography; throat culture; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; imipenem, 64221-86-9; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; meropenem, 96036-03-2; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9",,,"Ilam University of Medical Sciences","This research was approved and supported by the Deputy of Research and Technology of Ilam University of Medical Sciences under the ethical code of IR.MEDILAM.REC.1399.008 .",,"Bussel, J.B., Szatrowski, T.P., Uses of intravenous gamma globulininimmune hematologic disease (1995) Immunol.

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. Case presentation: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. Conclusions: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases. © 2020 The Author(s).","Case report; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Manila; Philippines; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; bacterial DNA; ceftriaxone; meropenem; midazolam; oseltamivir; oxygen; vancomycin; virus RNA; adult; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; bacterium detection; blood culture; case report; chill; Chinese; clinical article; clinical feature; combination drug therapy; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; coronovirus disease 2019; coughing; crackle; disease course; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; female; fever; general condition deterioration; heart arrest; hemoptysis; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; Human coronavirus 229E; influenza B; Klebsiella pneumoniae infection; loading drug dose; male; oxygen desaturation; Philippines; physical examination; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract intubation; restlessness; resuscitation; sedation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; Staphylococcus aureus infection; Streptococcus pneumonia; thorax radiography; throat culture; tracheal aspiration procedure; travel; urine volume; virus detection",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; meropenem, 96036-03-2; midazolam, 59467-70-8; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; oxygen, 7782-44-7; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9",,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019.

At present, the efforts of various countries focus on the rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients, as well as to find a treatment that can combat the most serious impact of the disease. The number of reported COVID-19 virus infections is still increasing. Unfortunately, no drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of human coronaviruses, but there is an urgent need for in-depth research on emerging human infectious coronaviruses. Clarification transmission routes and pathogenic mechanisms, and identification of potential drug treatment targets will promote the development of effective prevention and treatment measures. In the absence of confirmed effective treatments, due to public health emergencies, it is essential to study the possible effects of existing approved antivirals drugs or Chinese herbal medicines for SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes the epidemiological characteristics, pathogenesis, virus structure and targeting strategies of COVID-19. Meanwhile, this review also focus on the re-purposing of clinically approved drugs and Chinese herbal medicines that may be used to treat COVID-19 and provide new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on novel COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chinese herbal medicines; COVID-19; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; Therapeutic agents; Treatment","arbidol; azithromycin; baicalin; baloxavir marboxil; baricitinib; chloroquine; danoprevir; darunavir; dipyridamole; ebastine; eidd 2801; emtricitabine; favipiravir; fingolimod; glycyrrhizic acid; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; luteolin; methylprednisolone; oseltamivir; quercetin; remdesivir; riamilovir; ribavirin; tenofovir; tranilast; umifenovir; unindexed drug; zinc; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug structure; drug targeting; gene structure; human; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus genome; virus morphology; virus pathogenesis; virus replication",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; baicalin, 21967-41-9; baloxavir marboxil, 1985606-14-1; baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; danoprevir, 916881-67-9, 1001913-18-3, 1225266-12-5, 850876-88-9, 916826-48-7; darunavir, 206361-99-1, 635728-49-3; dipyridamole, 58-32-2; ebastine, 90729-43-4; emtricitabine, 137530-41-7, 143491-54-7, 143491-57-0; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; glycyrrhizic acid, 1405-86-3; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; losartan, 114798-26-4; luteolin, 491-70-3; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; quercetin, 117-39-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; riamilovir, 123606-06-4, 928659-17-0; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; tenofovir, 147127-19-3, 147127-20-6; tranilast, 53902-12-8; umifenovir, 131707-25-0; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6","eidd 2801; gs 5734, Gilead; kaletra; t 705","Gilead","B2019016

Although most of the COVID-19 patients have mild or moderate courses, up to 5%–10% can have severe, potentially life threatening course, there is an urgent need for effective drugs. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy. There have been more than 300 clinical trials going on, various antiviral and immunomodulating agents are in various stages of evaluation for COVID-19 in those trials and some of them will be published in the next couple of months. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19 through randomized controlled studies, certain agents are being used all over the world based on either in-vitro or extrapolated evidence or observational studies. The most frequently used agents both in Turkey and all over the world including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir will be reviewed here.Nitazoxanide and ivermectin were also included in this review as they have recently been reported to have an activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and are licensed for the treatment of some other human infections. © TÜBİTAK.","Antiviral;

They have also been proposed for the treatment of several viral infections, due to their anti-viral effects in cell cultures and animal models, and, currently, for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) infection that is spreading all over the world. Although in some recent studies a clinical improvement in COVID-19 patients has been observed, the clinical efficacy of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19 has yet to be proven with randomized controlled studies, many of which are currently ongoing, also considering pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic level and duration of treatment and taking into account patients with different severity degrees of disease. Here we review what is currently known on the mechanisms of action of CQ and HCQ as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic drugs and discuss the up-to-date experimental evidence on the potential mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ in Sars-Cov2 infection and the current clinical knowledge on their efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Given the role of iron in several human viral infections, we also propose a different insight into a number of CQ and HCQ pharmacological effects, suggesting a potential involvement of iron homeostasis in Sars-Cov-2 infection and COVID-19 clinical course. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine; COVID-19; Inflammation; Iron; Sars-Cov-2; Thrombosis","azithromycin; blood clotting factor; chloroquine; cytokine; hepcidin; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; tumor necrosis factor; adaptive immunity; antiinflammatory activity; antithrombotic activity; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug withdrawal; endothelial dysfunction; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; innate immunity; iron deficiency anemia; iron homeostasis; iron metabolism; lung embolism; membrane binding; nonhuman; priority journal; QT prolongation; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombosis; virus attachment; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus particle; virus replication",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hepcidin, 342809-17-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6",,,"UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Brescia","This study was partly supported by the University of Brescia (fondi ex 60 % to Eugenia Quiros-Roldan, Giorgio Biasiotto and Isabella Zanella).",,"Touret, F., de Lamballerie, X., Of chloroquine and COVID-19 (2020) Antiviral Res., 5 (March (177)); Drakesmith, H., Prentice, A., Viral infection and iron metabolism (2008) Nat.

Objectives: To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19. Study design: A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China. Results: All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units. The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic. There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities. In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10–26 days). The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1–23 days). Conclusions: COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes. Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities. It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Children; Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); SARS-CoV-2","arbidol; azithromycin; C reactive protein; cefamandole; Chinese drug; glucose; lactate dehydrogenase; liver enzyme; lopinavir plus ritonavir; procalcitonin; abdominal pain; adolescent; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; Article; asymptomatic infection; blood clotting disorder; bronchopneumonia; child; China; Chinese medicine; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical study; coma; computer assisted tomography; consciousness; consciousness disorder; convulsion; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dehydration; diarrhea; digestive system function disorder; disease severity; dyspnea; family; fatigue; female; fever; fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction; glucose blood level; headache; heart muscle injury; human; hypoxia; infant; lethargy; leukocyte count; leukopenia; liver function; lymphadenopathy; lymphocytopenia; malaise; male; myalgia; nucleic acid analysis; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; rhabdomyolysis; school child; sepsis; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sore throat; thorax radiography; throat culture; upper respiratory tract infection; virus pneumonia; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; lung; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adolescent; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Female; Fever; Humans; Infant; Lung; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; cefamandole, 30034-03-8, 34444-01-4; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province: 2019JH8/10300023

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use. © 2020 by the authors.

No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation. We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NF-κB and addressing “cytokine storm syndrome” and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. © 2020 The Authors","ARDS; COVID 19; Glutathione; N-acetyl-cysteine; NF-κB; Pneumonia","acetylcysteine; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antinuclear antibody; ascorbic acid; atovaquone; azithromycin; beta glucan; bicarbonate; C reactive protein; cardiolipin antibody; curcumin; glucosinolate; glutathione; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; mercury; nitazoxanide; paracetamol; prasterone; pregnenolone; probiotic agent; proguanil; rheumatoid factor; salbutamol; testosterone; thioctic acid; zinc; adult; Anaplasma; anosmia; antibody detection; Article; Babesia; blood level; case report; Caucasian; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; diarrhea; drug dose reduction; dysgeusia; dyspnea; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fatigue; female; fever; flu like syndrome; fluid therapy; human; infection risk; insomnia; lack of drug effect; loading drug dose; low back pain; Lyme disease; male; medical history; metallic taste; mixed infection; night sweat; oxygen therapy; pneumonia; priority journal; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; treatment response; Western blotting; x-ray computed tomography",,"acetylcysteine, 616-91-1; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 74469-00-4, 79198-29-1; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; atovaquone, 94015-53-9, 95233-18-4; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; bicarbonate, 144-55-8, 71-52-3; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; curcumin, 458-37-7; glutathione, 70-18-8; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin G, 97794-27-9; immunoglobulin M, 9007-85-6; mercury, 14302-87-5, 7439-97-6; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4; paracetamol, 103-90-2; prasterone, 53-43-0; pregnenolone, 145-13-1; proguanil, 500-92-5, 637-32-1, 46920-30-3; rheumatoid factor, 9009-79-4; salbutamol, 18559-94-9, 35763-26-9; testosterone, 58-22-0; thioctic acid, 1077-29-8, 2319-84-8, 62-46-4; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,,"We would like to thank the MSIDS Research Foundation (MRF) for providing us research grants for the publication of this study.

New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hypothesis: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID-19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including glutathione, vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and “cytokine storm syndrome” with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to “acute respiratory distress syndrome” (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NF-κB and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione with associated anti-viral effects should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID-19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. Conclusion and Implications: A three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with ivermectin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NF-κB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials. © 2020 The Authors","ARDS; COVID-19; Cytokine storm syndrome; DIC; Glutathione; Macrophage activation syndrome; N-Acetyl-cysteine; NF-κB; Nrf2; Pneumonia","acetazolamide; acetylcysteine; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; beta glucan; chloroquine; curcumin; glutathione; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon beta serine; ivermectin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; melatonin; mercaptopurine; nitazoxanide; rapamycin; remdesivir; ribavirin; sildenafil; sulforaphane; sulforaphane glucosinolate; thioctic acid; unclassified drug; zinc; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease transmission; disseminated intravascular clotting; hand washing; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; infection prevention; inflammation; isolation; macrophage activation syndrome; morbidity; mortality; multiple organ failure; oxidative stress; pneumonia; pulmonary hypertension; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory failure; sepsis; thrombosis; upper respiratory tract infection",,"acetazolamide, 1424-27-7, 59-66-5; acetylcysteine, 616-91-1; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; curcumin, 458-37-7; glutathione, 70-18-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; interferon beta serine, 90598-63-3, 145155-23-3; ivermectin, 70288-86-7; melatonin, 73-31-4; mercaptopurine, 31441-78-8, 50-44-2, 6112-76-1; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sildenafil, 139755-83-2; sulforaphane, 142925-33-5, 4478-93-7; thioctic acid, 1077-29-8, 2319-84-8, 62-46-4; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6",,,,"We would like to thank the MSIDS Research Foundation (MRF) for providing a research grant for the publication of this study.

However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chloroquine; COVID-19; Dosage regimens; Dose related toxicity; Modeling and simulation","Safety engineering; Adverse effect; Concentration levels; Length of hospital stays; Maximum tolerated dose; QT prolongation; Safety concerns; Safety information; Simulation technique; Patient treatment; azithromycin; chloroquine; aging; Article; body weight; cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; dose response; drug accumulation; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug distribution; drug dose comparison; drug dose regimen; drug potentiation; drug safety; early intervention; high risk patient; human; hypoglycemia; lung edema; maximum tolerated dose; neurologic disease; priority journal; QT prolongation; respiratory failure; retention time; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; simulation; visual disorder",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7",,,,,,"Albertson, T.E., (2012), Chapter 51.

However, arrhythmia manifestations and treatment strategies used in these patients have not been well-described. We sought to better understand the cardiac arrhythmic manifestations and treatment strategies in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through a worldwide cross-sectional survey. Methods: The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) sent an online survey (via SurveyMonkey) to electrophysiology (EP) professionals (physicians, scientists, and allied professionals) across the globe. The survey was active from March 27 to April 13, 2020. Results: A total of 1197 respondents completed the survey with 50% of respondents from outside the USA, representing 76 countries and 6 continents. Of respondents, 905 (76%) reported having COVID-19-positive patients in their hospital. Atrial fibrillation was the most commonly reported tachyarrhythmia whereas severe sinus bradycardia and complete heart block were the most common bradyarrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation arrest and pulseless electrical activity were reported by 4.8% and 5.6% of respondents, respectively. There were 140 of 631 (22.2%) respondents who reported using anticoagulation therapy in all COVID-19-positive patients who did not otherwise have an indication. One hundred fifty-five of 498 (31%) reported regular use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZM); concomitant use of AZM was more common in the USA. Sixty of 489 respondents (12.3%) reported having to discontinue therapy with HCQ + AZM due to significant QTc prolongation and 20 (4.1%) reported cases of Torsade de Pointes in patients on HCQ/chloroquine and AZM. Amiodarone was the most common antiarrhythmic drug used for ventricular arrhythmia management. Conclusions: In this global survey of > 1100 EP professionals regarding hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a variety of arrhythmic manifestations were observed, ranging from benign to potentially life-threatening. Observed adverse events related to use of HCQ + AZM included prolonged QTc requiring drug discontinuation as well as Torsade de Pointes. Large prospective studies to better define arrhythmic manifestations as well as the safety of treatment strategies in COVID-19 patients are warranted. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Arrhythmia; Cardiac arrhythmia; COVID-19; QTc; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Coronaviruscases.Worldometer.2020.www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/; Covid-19 Interactive Map.

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems. Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%). The best prevention is to avoid exposure. In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine. COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers. A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases. A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases. Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available. Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment. © 2020 Via Medica.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Healthcare; Medical stuff; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Symptoms; Treatment","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; azithromycin; beta interferon; chloroquine; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 7; lopinavir plus ritonavir; noradrenalin; tumor necrosis factor; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; acute respiratory failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; extracorporeal oxygenation; fever; hand disinfection; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus HKU1; Human coronavirus NL63; influenza; intensive care unit; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality rate; multiple organ failure; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; noninvasive ventilation; oxygen therapy; pneumonia; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; adverse event; artificial ventilation; Betacoronavirus; clinical decision making; clinical pathway; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; extracorporeal oxygenation; laboratory technique; mass communication; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; oxygen therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; patient selection; prognosis; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Decision-Making; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Combined Modality Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Pathways; Diffusion of Innovation; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Respiration, Artificial; Risk Factors; Viral Vaccines",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; noradrenalin, 1407-84-7, 51-41-2; Antiviral Agents; COVID-19 vaccine; Viral Vaccines",,,"European Research Council, ERC","Study was supported by the ERC Research Net as well as the Polish Society of Disaster",,"Bramanti, B., Dean, K.R., Walløe, L., The Third Plague Pandemic in Europe (2019) Proc Biol Sci, 286 (1901). , 30991930; Flecknoe, D., Wakefield, B.C., Simmons, A., Plagues & wars: The ‘Spanish Flu’ pandemic as a lesson from history (2018) Med Confl Surviv, 34 (2), pp. 61-68; Joseph, U., Linster, M., Suzuki, Y., Adaptation of pandemic H2N2 influenza A viruses in humans (2015) J Virol, 89 (4). , 25505070; Viboud, C., Grais, R.F., Lafont, B.A.P., Multinational impact of the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic: Evidence for a smoldering pandemic (2005) J Infect Dis, 192 (2), pp. 233-248. , 15962218; Li, H., Cao, B., Pandemic and avian influenza a viruses in humans: Epidemiology, virology, clinical characteristics, and treatment strategy (2017) Clin Chest Med., 38 (1), pp. 59-70. , 28159162; Baseler, L., Chertow, D.S., Johnson, K.M., The pathogenesis of ebola virus disease (2017) Annu Rev Pathol, 12, pp. 387-418. , 27959626; Adams, M.J., Carstens, E.B., Ratification vote on taxonomic proposals to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (2012) (2012) Arch Virol, 157 (7), pp. 1411-1422. , 22481600; Wong, A.C.P., Li, X., Lau, S.K.P., Global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (2019) Viruses, 11 (2); Hu, B., Ge, X., Wang, L.F., Bat origin of human coronaviruses (2015) Virol J, 12, p. 221; Adhikari, S.P., Meng, S., Wu, Y.J., Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: A scoping review (2020) Infect Dis Poverty, 9 (1). , 32183901; Banerjee, A., Kulcsar, K., Misra, V., Bats and Coronaviruses (2019) Viruses, 11 (1); Cui, J., Li, F., Shi, Z.L., Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses (2019) Nat Rev Microbiol, 17 (3), pp. 181-192. , 30531947; Luk, H.K.H., Li, X., Fung, J., Molecular epidemiology, evolution and phylogeny of SARS coronavirus (2019) Infect Genet Evol, 71, pp. 21-30. , 30844511; Bradley, B.T., Bryan, A., Emerging respiratory infections: The infectious disease pathology of SARS, MERS, pandemic influenza, and Legionella (2019) Semin Diagn Pathol, 36 (3), pp. 152-159. , 31054790; Singh, S.K., Middle east respiratory syndrome virus pathogenesis (2016) Semin Respir Crit Care Med, 37 (4), pp. 572-577. , 27486737; Peeri, N.C., Shrestha, N., Rahman, M., The SARS, MERS and novel coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemics, the newest and biggest global health threats: What lessons have we learned?

The antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) and its metabolite hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are currently being tested in several clinical studies as potential candidates to limit SARS-CoV-2-mediated morbidity and mortality. CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy. Therefore, CQ/HCQ in combination with zinc should be considered as additional study arm for COVID-19 clinical trials. © 2020 The Authors","Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy; Zinc","azithromycin; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; RNA directed RNA polymerase; zinc; zinc sulfate; antiviral activity; Article; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; human; nonhuman; pH; practice guideline; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication; zinc deficiency",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; RNA directed RNA polymerase, 9026-28-2; zinc, 7440-66-6, 14378-32-6; zinc sulfate, 7733-02-0",,,,,,"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6, [consulted on 2020-04-22]; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Cui-Cui, L., Xiao-Jia, W., Hwa-Chain, R.W., Repurposing host-based therapeutics to control coronavirus and influenza virus (2019) Drug Discovery Today, 24 (3), pp. 726-736; Smith, T., Bushek, J., Prosser, T., https://www.elsevier.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/988648/COVID-19-Drug-Therapy_Mar-2020.pdf, COVID-19 drug therapy potential options.

While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, with a 3–6% mortality. A plethora of treatments has been or is being assessed, but to date, none has been proven effective. Management is mainly symptomatic, with organ support for the critically ill. Several reports, mainly case series, from across the world have concluded that patients with malignancy appear more susceptible to severe infection and mortality from COVID-19. This could be attributed to immunosuppression, co-existing medical conditions and underlying pulmonary compromise which is often the case in lung malignancy. Patients with haematological cancer and those who are receiving active chemotherapy treatment may be at greatest risk due to increased immunosuppression. This pandemic tested the resilience of worldwide health-care systems in an unprecedented manner. It has forced oncologists to rethink the entire diagnostic and therapeutic process, based on the local prevalence and impact of COVID-19. In this review we will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients affected by cancer, their diagnosis and management, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress symptoms and currently investigated treatment approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Covid-19; Immunotherapy; Mortality; NSCLC","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; canakinumab; chloroquine; corticosteroid; gamma interferon; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrophage inflammatory protein; monocyte chemotactic protein; ruxolitinib; siltuximab; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; biological therapy; blood transfusion; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; health care management; herd immunity; human; malignant neoplasm; pandemic; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); protein blood level; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; canakinumab, 402710-25-2, 402710-27-4, 914613-48-2; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Al-Qahtani, A.A., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2): emergence, history, basic and clinical aspects (2020) Saudi J Biol Sci; (2019), WHO.

Objective: To characterize the risk and degree of QT prolongation in patients with COVID-19 in association with their use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cohort study performed at an academic tertiary care center in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients hospitalized with at least 1 positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test result and clinical findings consistent with pneumonia who received at least 1 day of hydroxychloroquine from March 1, 2020, through April 7, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in QT interval after receiving hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin; occurrence of other potential adverse drug events. Results: Among 90 patients given hydroxychloroquine, 53 received concomitant azithromycin; 44 (48.9%) were female, and the mean (SD) body mass index was 31.5 (6.6). Hypertension (in 48 patients [53.3%]) and diabetes mellitus (in 26 patients [28.9%]) were the most common comorbid conditions. The overall median (interquartile range) baseline QTc was 455 (430-474) milliseconds (hydroxychloroquine, 473 [454-487] milliseconds vs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 442 [427-461] milliseconds; P <.001). Those receiving concomitant azithromycin had a greater median (interquartile range) change in QT interval (23 [10-40] milliseconds) compared with those receiving hydroxychloroquine alone (5.5 [-15.5 to 34.25] milliseconds; P =.03). Seven patients (19%) who received hydroxychloroquine monotherapy developed prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more, and 3 patients (3%) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. Of those who received concomitant azithromycin, 11 of 53 (21%) had prolonged QTc of 500 milliseconds or more and 7 of 53 (13 %) had a change in QTc of 60 milliseconds or more. The likelihood of prolonged QTc was greater in those who received concomitant loop diuretics (adjusted odds ratio, 3.38 [95% CI, 1.03-11.08]) or had a baseline QTc of 450 milliseconds or more (adjusted odds ratio, 7.11 [95% CI, 1.75-28.87]). Ten patients had hydroxychloroquine discontinued early because of potential adverse drug events, including intractable nausea, hypoglycemia, and 1 case of torsades de pointes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients who received hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were at high risk of QTc prolongation, and concurrent treatment with azithromycin was associated with greater changes in QTc. Clinicians should carefully weigh risks and benefits if considering hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with close monitoring of QTc and concomitant medication usage. © 2020 American Medical Association.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immunocompromised patients, including those requiring immunosuppression following renal transplantation, as high risk for severe disease from SARS-CoV-2. Treatment for other viral infections in renal transplant recipients often includes a reduction in immunosuppression; however, no current guidelines are available recommending the optimal approach to managing immunosuppression in the patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is currently advised to avoid corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 outside of critically ill patients. Recently published cases describing inpatient care of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients differ widely in disease severity, time from transplantation, baseline immunosuppressive therapy, and the modifications made to immunosuppression during COVID-19 treatment. This review summarizes and compares inpatient immunosuppressant management strategies of recently published reports in the renal transplant population infected with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the limitations of corticosteroids in managing immunosuppression in this patient population. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","coronavirus; corticosteroid; COVID-19; immunosuppression; renal transplant; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; bicarbonate; cefepime; corticosteroid; creatinine; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; ketoconazole; mycophenolic acid; tacrolimus; valganciclovir; abdominal discomfort; abdominal radiography; adolescent; adult; African American; aged; anorexia; backache; bloating; chill; clinical article; community acquired pneumonia; computer assisted tomography; congestive heart failure; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; creatinine blood level; cytomegalovirus infection; dehydration; differential diagnosis; drug dose reduction; drug megadose; end stage renal disease; evening dosage; fatigue; female; fever; graft recipient; human; influenza; kidney graft; kidney graft rejection; laboratory test; leukocyte count; leukopenia; lung edema; malaise; male; metabolic acidosis; middle aged; myalgia; neutropenia; outcome assessment; physical examination; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; respiratory tract disease; Review; thorax radiography; urine volume; young adult",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; bicarbonate, 144-55-8, 71-52-3; cefepime, 88040-23-7; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ketoconazole, 65277-42-1; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; valganciclovir, 175865-59-5, 175865-60-8, 175865-61-9, 175865-62-0, 175865-64-2, 175865-67-5",,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China (2020) JAMA, 323, p. 1239; First travel-related case of 2019 novel coronavirus detected in the United States, , https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html, Accessed April 6, 2020; Interim infection prevention and control recommendations for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare settings, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/controlrecommendations.html, Updated April 1, 2020., Accessed April 6, 2020; Guillen, E., Pineiro, G.J., Revuelta, I., Case report of COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient: does immunosuppression alter the clinical presentation?

The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected. To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill. While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use. This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adjunctive treatment;

Several improvements have been made, including discovery of the clinical efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) in patients with COVID-19, but effective treatment protocols remain elusive. In the search for novel treatment options, many scientists have used the in-silico approach to identify compounds that could interfere with the key molecules involved in entrance, replication or dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, most of the identified molecules are not available as pharmacological agents at present, and assessment of their safety and efficacy could take many months. This review took a different approach based on the proposed pharmacodynamic model of CQ in COVID-19. The main mechanism of action responsible for the favourable outcome of patients with COVID-19 treated with CQ seems to be related to a pH-modulation-mediated effect on endolysosomal trafficking, a characteristic of chemical compounds often called ‘lysosomotropic agents’ because of the physico-chemical properties that enable them to diffuse passively through the endosomal membrane and undergo protonation-based trapping in the lumen of the acidic vesicles. This review discusses lysosomotropic and lysosome targeting drugs that are already in clinical use and are characterized by good safety profiles, low cost and wide availability. Some of these drugs –particularly azithromycin and other macrolides, indomethacin and some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and fluoxetine – could provide additional therapeutic benefits in addition to the potential antiviral effect that is still to be confirmed by well-controlled clinical trials. As some of these drugs have probably been used empirically in the treatment of COVID-19, it is hoped that colleagues worldwide will publish patient data to enable evaluation of the potential efficacy of these agents in the clinical context, and rapid implementation in therapeutic protocols if they are shown to have a beneficial effect on clinical outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral; COVID-19; Drug repurposing; Endosome; Lysosomotropic agents",,,,,,,,,"Agelidis, A.M., Shukla, D., Cell entry mechanisms of HSV: what we have learned in recent years (2015) Fut Virol, 10, pp. 1145-1154; Burkard, C., Verheije, M.H., Wicht, O., van Kasteren, S.I., van Kuppeveld, F.J., Haagmans, B.L., Coronavirus cell entry occurs through the endo-/lysosomal pathway in a proteolysis-dependent manner (2014) PLoS Pathog, 10; Novoa, R.R., Calderita, G., Arranz, R., Fontana, J., Granzow, H., Risco, C., Virus factories: associations of cell organelles for viral replication and morphogenesis (2005) Biol Cell, 97, pp. 147-172; Staring, J., Raaben, M., Brummelkamp, T.R., Viral escape from endosomes and host detection at a glance (2018) J Cell Sci, 131 (15), p. 131; Marsh, M., Helenius, A., Virus entry: open sesame (2006) Cell, 124, pp. 729-740; Scott, C.C., Gruenberg, J., Ion flux and the function of endosomes and lysosomes: pH is just the start: the flux of ions across endosomal membranes influences endosome function not only through regulation of the luminal pH (2011) Bioessays, 33, pp. 103-110; Mazzon, M., Marsh, M., Targeting viral entry as a strategy for broad-spectrum antivirals (2019) F1000Res, 8, p. 1628; Marshansky, V., Futai, M., The V-type H+-ATPase in vesicular trafficking: targeting, regulation and function (2008) Curr Opin Cell Biol, 20, pp. 415-426; Hu, Y.-B., Dammer, E.B., Ren, R.-J., Wang, G., The endosomal–lysosomal system: from acidification and cargo sorting to neurodegeneration (2015) Transl Neurodegener, 4, p. 18; Fredericksen, B.L., Wei, B.L., Yao, J., Luo, T., Garcia, J.V., Inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal degradation increases the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus (2002) J Virol, 76, pp. 11440-11446; Gao, J., Tian, Z., Yang, X., Breakthrough: chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies (2020) Biosci Trends, 14, pp. 72-73; Cortegiani, A., Ingoglia, G., Ippolito, M., Giarratano, A., Einav, S., A systematic review on the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 (2020) J Crit Care, 57, pp. 279-283; Dong, L., Hu, S., Gao, J., Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Drug Discov Ther, 14, pp. 58-60; Liu, J., Cao, R., Xu, M., Wang, X., Zhang, H., Hu, H., Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (2020) Cell Discov, 6, p. 269; Wang, H., Yang, P., Liu, K., Guo, F., Zhang, Y., Zhang, G., SARS coronavirus entry into host cells through a novel clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic pathway (2008) Cell Res, 18, pp. 290-301; Simmons, G., Reeves, J.D., Rennekamp, A.J., Amberg, S.M., Piefer, A.J., Bates, P., Characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein-mediated viral entry (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 101, pp. 4240-4245; De Duve, C., De Barsy, T., Poole, B., Trouet, A., Tulkens, P., Van Hoof, F., Lysosomotropic agents (1974) Biochem Pharmacol, 23, pp. 2495-2531; Marceau, F., Bawolak, M.-T., Lodge, R., Bouthillier, J., Gagné-Henley, A., Gaudreault, R.C., Cation trapping by cellular acidic compartments: beyond the concept of lysosomotropic drugs (2012) Toxicol Appl Pharmacol, 259, pp. 1-12; Dartois, V., The path of anti-tuberculosis drugs: from blood to lesions to mycobacterial cells (2014) Nat Rev Microbiol, 12, pp. 159-167; Jia, L., Tomaszewski, J.E., Hanrahan, C., Coward, L., Noker, P., Gorman, G., Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of SQ109, a new diamine-based antitubercular drug (2005) Br J Pharmacol, 144, pp. 80-87; Shkurupii, V.A., Kozyaev, M.A., Nadeev, A.P., Ultrastructural characteristics of type A epithelioid cells during BCG-granulomatosis and treatment with lysosomotropic isoniazid (2006) Bull Exp Biol Med, 141, pp. 487-490; Schump, M.D., Fox, D.M., Bertozzi, C.R., Riley, L.W., Subcellular partitioning and intramacrophage selectivity of antimicrobial compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (2017) Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 61 (3); https://clinicaltrials.gov/, ClinicalTrials.gov.

With no vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable. Using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides (MAC) were predicted to be effective for COVID-19. Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19. We believe that treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to fight this emerging viral infection. © 2019 International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research Co., Ltd.","COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, macrolide","antivirus agent; macrolide; proteinase inhibitor; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; enzymology; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; structure activity relation; virology; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Macrolides; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protease Inhibitors; Structure-Activity Relationship",,"proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; Antiviral Agents; Macrolides; Protease Inhibitors",,,,,,"Dayer, M.R., Old drugs for newly emerging viral disease, COVID-19 Bioinformatic Prospective, , https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.04524.pdf, arXiv: 2003.0. 2020-arxiv. org.

So far information is scarce and rapidly emerging. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a single engine search for studies assessing thrombosis and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients. Additional studies were identified by secondary review and alert services. Results: Studies reported the occurrence of venous thromboembolism and stroke in approximately 20% and 3% of patients, respectively. A higher frequency seems to be present in severely ill patients, in particular those admitted to intensive care units. The thrombotic risk is elevated despite the use of anticoagulant prophylaxis but optimal doses of anticoagulation are not yet defined. Although an increase of biomarkers such as D-dimer has been consistently reported in severely ill COVID-19, the optimal cut-off level and prognostic value are not known. Discussion: A number of pressing issues were identified by this review, including defining the true incidence of VTE in COVID patients, developing algorithms to identify those susceptible to develop thrombotic complications and severe disease, determining the role of biomarkers and/or scoring systems to stratify patients' risk, designing adequate and feasible diagnostic protocols for PE, establishing the optimal thromboprophylaxis strategy, and developing uniform diagnostic and reporting criteria. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anticoagulation; COVID-19; Venous thromboembolism","alteplase; anticoagulant agent; azithromycin; D dimer; darunavir plus ritonavir; enoxaparin; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; levofloxacin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; phospholipid antibody; prothrombin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; cerebrovascular accident; coronary angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; echography; human; incidence; intensive care unit; lung embolism; lung scintiscanning; optical coherence tomography; platelet count; priority journal; prognosis; prothrombin time; reference value; risk assessment; scoring system; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; systematic review; thorax radiography; thrombosis; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; venous thromboembolism",,"alteplase, 105857-23-6; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; prothrombin, 9001-26-7",,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR: CDT-142654","FA-A is a former fellow of the Canadian Venous Thromboembolism Clinical Trials and Outcomes Research (CanVECTOR) Network.

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. Recent Findings: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. Summary: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiac injury; Cardiovascular system; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Immune response; SARS-CoV-2","adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; chloroquine; CXCL11 chemokine; CXCL9 chemokine; eculizumab; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glucocorticoid; granzyme B; hemagglutinin esterase protein; HLA DR antigen; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 2; lopinavir plus ritonavir; M protein; nucleocapsid protein; perforin; remdesivir; sarilumab; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; viral protein; virus envelope protein; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; adaptive immunity; adult respiratory distress syndrome; age; antigen presentation; B lymphocyte; cardiotoxicity; CD3+ T lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; endothelial dysfunction; endothelial inflammation; ferritin blood level; heart muscle injury; human; immune response; infection rate; inflammation; innate immunity; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; myocarditis; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein blood level; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; T lymphocyte activation; Th17 cell; toxicity; viral toxicity; virus entry; virus load; virus pathogenesis; virus replication; animal; Betacoronavirus; cardiac muscle cell; complication; Coronavirus infection; heart disease; hypoxia; immunology; metabolism; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Heart Diseases; Humans; Hypoxia; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; granzyme B; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; perforin, 119332-27-3; proprotein convertase 9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; serine protease HTRA1; serine proteinase, 37259-58-8; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Cytokines; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",,,"American Heart Association, AHA: 17EIA33410923

The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7–10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis.

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. Objectives: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords “COVID 19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “treatment.” All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. Discussion: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. Conclusion: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","COVID 19; Favipiravir; Hydroxychloroquine; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Guo, Y.R., Cao, Q.D., Hong, Z.S., The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - an update on the status (2020) Mil Med Res, 7 (1), p. 11; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Information for clinicians on therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html;, (Accessed 27 March 2020); Fang, L., Karakiulakis, G., Roth, M., Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?

The virus is highly contagious with potential human-human transmission which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across six continents and emerged as a global pandemic in short span with alarming levels of spread and severity. This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 possesses enveloped club-like spike protein projections with positive-sense large RNA genome and has a unique replication strategy. This virus was believed to have zoonotic origin with genetical identity to bat and pangolin CoV. In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity. Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options.

This virus has a high infectivity rate and has impacted a significant chunk of the population worldwide. The spectrum of disease ranges from mild to severe with respiratory system being the most commonly affected. Cardiovascular system often gets involved in later stages of the disease with acute cardiac injury, heart failure and arrhythmias being the common complications. In addition, the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease in these patients are often associated with poor prognosis. It is still not clear regarding the exact mechanism explaining cardiovascular system involvement in COVID-19. Multiple theories have been put forward however, more robust studies are required to fully elucidate the “heart and virus” link. The disease has already made its presence felt on the global stage and its impact in the developing countries is mer going to be profound. These nations not only have a poorly developed healthcare system but there is also a huge burden of cardiovascular diseases. As a result, COVID-19 would adversely impact the already overburdened healthcare network leading to impaired cardiovascular care delivery especially for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure patients. © The Author(s), 2020","Acute respiratory distress syndrome;

Different actions to cope with this situation are being developed, including confinement, different treatments to improve symptoms, and the creation of the first vaccines. In epidemiology, herd immunity is presented as an area that could also solve this new global threat. In this review, we present the basis of herd immunology, the dynamics of infection transmission that induces specific immunity, and how the application of immunoepidemiology and herd immunology could be used to control the actual COVID-19 pandemic, along with a discussion of its effectiveness, limitations, and applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Under these unprecedented circumstances, there are no well-established guidelines for cancer patients. Recent Findings: The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases increases with advancing age and presence of comorbid health conditions. Since the emergence of the first case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, tremendous research efforts have been underway to understand the mechanisms of infectivity and transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a fatal virus responsible for abysmal survival outcomes. To minimize the mortality rate, it becomes prudent to identify symptoms promptly and employ treatments appropriately. Even though no cure has been established, multiple clinical trials are underway to determine the most optimal strategy. Managing cancer patients under these circumstances is rather challenging, given their vulnerable status and the aggressive nature of their underlying disease. Summary: In this comprehensive review, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on health and the immune system of those affected, reviewing the latest treatment approaches and ongoing clinical trials. Additionally, we discuss challenges faced while treating cancer patients and propose potential approaches to manage this vulnerable population during this pandemic. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ACE2; ARDS; Cancer; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Immune response; Pandemic; Pneumonia; SARS; SARS-CoV-2","alpha2b interferon; anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; arbidol; azithromycin; baricitinib; bevacizumab; camostat mesilate; CD24Fc; chloroquine; cobicistat plus darunavir; colchicine; deferoxamine; dexamethasone; emapalumab; favipiravir; fingolimod; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; leronlimab; lisinopril; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; methylprednisolone; nitric oxide; nivolumab; oseltamivir; ruxolitinib; unindexed drug; valsartan; antivirus agent; age; cancer patient; China; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; early diagnosis; early intervention; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; immune response; malignant neoplasm; medical research; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; mortality rate; pandemic; pathogenesis; patient care; plasma transfusion; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; Review; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; virus entry; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospital mortality; immunocompromised patient; immunology; neoplasm; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors",,"alpha2b interferon, 99210-65-8; anakinra, 143090-92-0; arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; bevacizumab, 216974-75-3, 1438851-35-4; camostat mesilate, 59721-29-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; deferoxamine, 70-51-9; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; emapalumab, 1709815-23-5; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; leronlimab, 674782-26-4; lisinopril, 76547-98-3, 83915-83-7; losartan, 114798-26-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; nivolumab, 946414-94-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; valsartan, 137862-53-4; Antiviral Agents",,,,,,"Bogoch, I.I., Watts, A., Thomas-Bachli, A., Huber, C., Kraemer, M.U.G., Khan, K., Pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China: Potential for international spread via commercial air travel (2020) J Travel Med, p. 27; Lu, H., Stratton, C.W., Tang, Y.W., Outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China: The mystery and the miracle (2020) J.

As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed health care systems, strangled the global economy, and led to a devastating loss of life. Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians, and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The authors review the most current data, with a focus on the basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics. The authors discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multiorgan consequences, and outcomes. With a focus on cardiovascular complications, they propose several mechanisms of injury. The virology and potential mechanism of injury form the basis for a discussion of potential disease-modifying therapies. © 2020","cardiovascular; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; treatments; virology","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiinflammatory agent; azithromycin; camostat; chloroquine; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; neutralizing antibody; nucleotide derivative; proteinase inhibitor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; siltuximab; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus vaccine; acute coronary syndrome; cardiogenic shock; cardiologist; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; human; infection control; kidney injury; life cycle; liver injury; membrane fusion; mortality; myocarditis; nonhuman; oxygen supply; patient care; resource allocation; respiratory failure; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; thrombosis; viral genetics; virology; virus genome; virus morphology; virus transmission",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat, 59721-28-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; siltuximab, 541502-14-1",,,,,,"Fehr, A.R., Perlman, S., Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis (2015) Methods Mol Biol, 1282, pp. 1-23; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Cui, J., Li, F., Shi, Z.L., Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses (2019) Nature reviews Microbiology, 17, pp. 181-192; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 270-273; Wu, F., Zhao, S., Yu, B., A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 265-269; Prentice, E., McAuliffe, J., Lu, X., Subbarao, K., Denison, M.R., Identification and characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replicase proteins (2004) J Virol, 78, pp. 9977-9986; Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., Schroeder, S., SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor (2020) Cell, 181, pp. 271-280.e8; Du, L., He, Y., Zhou, Y., Liu, S., Zheng, B.J., Jiang, S., The spike protein of SARS-CoV–a target for vaccine and therapeutic development (2009) Nat Rev Microbiol, 7, pp. 226-236; Wrapp, D., Wang, N., Corbett, K.S., Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation (2020) Science, 367, pp. 1260-1263; Yan, R., Zhang, Y., Li, Y., Xia, L., Guo, Y., Zhou, Q., Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 (2020) Science, 367, pp. 1444-1448; Shang, J., Ye, G., Shi, K., Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Nature, , [E-pub ahead of print]; Siu, Y.L., Teoh, K.T., Lo, J., The M, E, and N structural proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are required for efficient assembly, trafficking, and release of virus-like particles (2008) J Virol, 82, pp. 11318-11330; Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., Tortorici, M.A., Wall, A., McGuire, A.T., Veesler, D., Structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (2020) Cell, 181, pp. 281-292.e6; Bosch, B.J., Smits, S.L., Haagmans, B.L., Membrane ectopeptidases targeted by human coronaviruses (2014) Curr Opin Virol, 6, pp. 55-60; Cheng, A., Zhang, W., Xie, Y., Expression, purification, and characterization of SARS coronavirus RNA polymerase (2005) Virology, 335, pp. 165-176; Li, W., Moore, M.J., Vasilieva, N., Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (2003) Nature, 426, pp. 450-454; Dijkman, R., Jebbink, M.F., Deijs, M., Replication-dependent downregulation of cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein expression by human coronavirus NL63 (2012) J Gen Virol, 93. , 1924–9; Vaduganathan, M., Vardeny, O., Michel, T., McMurray, J.J.V., Pfeffer, M.A., Solomon, S.D., Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1653-1659; Clerkin, K.J., Fried, J.A., Raikhelkar, J., Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease (2020) Circulation, , [E-pub ahead of print]; Brosnihan, K.B., Neves, L.A., Chappell, M.C., Does the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ACE2 balance contribute to the fate of angiotensin peptides in programmed hypertension?

Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented. Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease. This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes. Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized. © Mattioli 1885.","Antivirals; COVID-19; Drugs; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; baricitinib; camostat mesilate;

Design: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE). A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. Setting: The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Participants: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. Interventions: TCZ was administered to 21 patients. The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. Results: There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years). Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin). No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration. This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC. Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels. Variation in lymphocytes count was observed over time, irrespective of treatment. Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients. Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy's potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES: COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS: All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION: This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. Larger studies are likely to define the role of HBOT in the treatment of this novel disease.","COVID-19; HBOT; oxygen saturation; SARS; SARS-CoV-2; ventilation","adult; artificial ventilation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; female; human; hyperbaric oxygen therapy; male; middle aged; pandemic; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Hyperbaric Oxygenation; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,09690700,,,"32412891","English","J Wound Care",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084885832

Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic. In order to solve this bioethical problem, we strongly recommend that a randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting be carried out as a matter of urgency in these areas of the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioethics; Clinical trials; Developing countries; Hydroxychloroquine/ chloroquine; Primary care","azithromycin; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; bioethics; coronavirus disease 2019; developing country; drug choice; drug safety; Editorial; human; infection prevention; practice guideline; primary medical care; priority journal; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial; solidarity clinical trial; World Health Organization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5",,,,,,"Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial (2020) Int.

Since then it has spread in more than 210 countries and territories. It is a viral disease due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The patients show flu-like symptoms with a dry cough, sore throat, high fever, and breathing problems. The disease due to SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. About 2.2 million people have been infected with more than 0.15 million deaths globally. The United States of America is the most affected country with the highest patients of about 0.7 million. Despite great efforts, there is no treatment of this disease. However, prevention and management are the best options. This article describes SARS-CoV-2, disease, prevention and management, treatment and social impact on society. It was analyzed that a combination of antiviral drugs with hydroxyl-chloroquine and azithromycin (with the consultation of a medical practitioner) may be the best option to treat the patients, depending on the patient's conditions and symptoms. However, Unani therapy may be useful along with allopathic treatment. It is urgently advised and requested that all the persons should follow the preventive measures, managements and quarantine strictly without any religious discrepancy otherwise the situation may be the worst. Also, there is an urgent requirement to educate our new generation for science and technology to fight against any such disaster in future; if any. There is no need to be panic and proper prevention and management are essential to combat this disease. This article may be useful to create awareness among the public, to prevent, manage and treat COVID-19. © 2020","COVID-19; Prevention and management; SARS-CoV-2; Social impact; Treatment","Economic and social effects; Viruses; Anti-viral drugs; Hubei Province; Medical practitioner; Preventive measures; Science and Technology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; United States of America; Viral disease; Diseases; alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; arbidol; ascorbic acid; black pepper extract; chloroquine; Cinnamomum verum extract; Curcuma longa extract; Daucus maritimus extract; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; favipiravir; galidesivir; ganciclovir; garlic extract; Glycyrrhiza glabra extract; lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nelfinavir; Ocimum sanctum extract; Ocimum tenuiflorum extract; onion extract; oseltamivir; plant extract; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; saikosaponin; saikosaponin B2; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin D; COVID-19; disease control; disease prevalence; disease treatment; drug; respiratory disease; social impact; viral disease; allopathy; Article; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; hand washing; health care management; homeopathy; human; immune system; infection prevention; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; pandemic; personal hygiene; priority journal; social impact; social problem; symptomatology; Unani medicine; United States; SARS coronavirus",,"alpha tocopherol, 1406-18-4, 1406-70-8, 52225-20-4, 58-95-7, 59-02-9; arbidol, 131707-23-8; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; galidesivir, 222631-44-9, 249503-25-1; ganciclovir, 82410-32-0; nelfinavir, 159989-64-7, 159989-65-8; onion extract, 8054-39-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; retinol, 68-26-8, 82445-97-4; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; saikosaponin, 98253-20-4",,,"Taibah University","The authors are thankful to the administration of Taibah University, Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah and Government of Saudi Arabia for providing facilities and the encouragement to write this article.

Although a large proportion of infected individuals develop only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the spectrum of the disease among others has been widely variable in severity. Additionally, many infected individuals were found to have coagulation markers abnormalities. This is especially true among those progressing to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. While the incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease has been recently noted to be elevated among critically ill patients, the incidence among ambulatory and non-critically ill patients is not yet clearly defined. Herein, we present six patients who didn't have any hypercoagulable risk factors yet presented with pulmonary embolism in association with COVID 19 infection. Furthermore, we discuss the possible underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability and highlight the possibility of underdiagnosing pulmonary embolism in the setting of overlapping symptoms, decreased utilization of imaging secondary to associated risks, and increased turnover times. In addition, we emphasize the role of extended thromboprophylaxis in discharged patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anticoagulation; COVID 19; Pulmonary embolism; Thrombolysis","apixaban; azithromycin; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; D dimer; enoxaparin; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; rivaroxaban; tissue plasminogen activator; troponin I; adult; aged; artificial ventilation; chill; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; dyspnea; female; fever; human; hypercoagulability; hypoxemia; Letter; leukocytosis; lung embolism; lung infiltrate; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; myalgia; neutrophilia; oxygen desaturation; oxygen therapy; pneumomediastinum; priority journal; QT prolongation; sinus tachycardia; subcutaneous emphysema; T wave inversion; thorax radiography",,"apixaban, 503612-47-3; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; brain natriuretic peptide, 114471-18-0; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; rivaroxaban, 366789-02-8; tissue plasminogen activator, 105913-11-9; troponin I, 77108-40-8",,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; Tang, N., Li, D., Wang, X., Sun, Z., Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (2020) J.

A 55-year-old male COVID-19-positive patient with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), diabetes, and obesity presented with cough and shortness of breath, escalating to requiring high-flow oxygen therapy by high-velocity nasal insufflation. The patient's flow rate and oxygen fraction remained labile throughout much of the hospitalization. This lability required frequent clinician interactions and use of personal protective equipment. The patient was alert and oriented and was instructed on the operation of the high-flow system, specifically the adjustment of both flow rate and oxygen percentage. The patient was instructed to modify oxygen to maintain an SpO2 (peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) target range, and flow rate to address dyspnoea as well as reduction of flow as tolerated when other staff entered the room. The patient was successfully self-regulated for 10 days and was discharged on 2 L/min nasal cannula on day 14 of his illness. © 2020 The Authors.

The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is one of the coronaviruses. Realizing the severity of outcomes associated with this disease and its high rate of transmission, dentists were instructed by regulatory authorities, such as the American Dental Association, to stop providing treatment to dental patients except those who have emergency complaints. This was mainly for protection of dental healthcare personnel, their families, contacts, and their patients from the transmission of virus, and also to preserve the much-needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). Dentists at all times should competently follow cross-infection control protocols, but particularly during this critical time, they should do their best to decide on the emergency cases that are indicated for dental treatment. Dentists should also be updated on how this pandemic is related to their profession in order to be well oriented and prepared. This overview will address several issues concerned with the COVID-19 pandemic that directly relate to dental practice in terms of prevention, treatment, and orofacial clinical manifestations. © 2020 by the authors.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have garnered unprecedented attention as potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19 following several small clinical trials, uncontrolled case series, and public figure endorsements. While there is a growing body of scientific data, there is also concern for harm, particularly QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias. Here, we perform a rapid narrative review and discuss the strengths and limitations of existing in vitro and clinical studies. We call for additional randomized controlled trial evidence prior to the widespread incorporation of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine into national and international treatment guidelines. © The Author(s) 2020.

Recent studies showed pneumothorax in rare cases, but tension pneumothorax has only been reported once. Case presentation: A 47-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dry cough and sore throat for the last 14 days as well as acute stenocardia and shortage of breath. Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed bipulmonary groundglass opacities and consolidations with peripheral distribution. Hospitalization with supportive therapy (azithromycin) as well as non-invasive oxygenation led to a stabilization of the patient. After 5 days, sputum testing was negative and IgA/IgG antibody titres were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was discharged after 7 days. On the 11th day, the patient realized pronounced dyspnoea after coughing and presented to the emergency department again. CT showed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which was relieved by a chest drain (Buelau) via mini open thoracotomy. Negative pressure therapy resulted in regression of the pneumothorax and the patient was discharged after 9 days of treatment. Conclusion: Treating physicians should be aware that COVID-19 patients might develop severe secondary pulmonary complications such as acute tension pneumothorax.

Methods: A case series of hospitalized COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients between February 24th through April 24th, 2020, from two hospitals in Oman. Analyses were performed using univariate statistics. Results: The cohort included 63 patients with an overall mean age of 48 ± 16 years and 84% (n = 53) were males. A total of 38% (n = 24) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty one percent (n = 32) of patients had at least one co-morbidity with diabetes mellitus (DM) (32%; n = 20) and hypertension (32%; n = 20) as the most common co-morbidities followed by chronic heart and renal diseases (12.8%; n = 8). The most common presenting symptoms at onset of illness were fever (84%; n = 53), cough (75%; n = 47) and shortness of breaths (59%; n = 37). All except two patients (97%; n = 61) were treated with either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, while the three most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone (79%; n = 50), azithromycin (71%; n = 45), and the piperacillin/tazobactam combination (49%; n = 31). A total of 59% (n = 37), 49% (n = 31) and 24% (n = 15) of the patients were on lopinavir/ritonavir, interferons, or steroids, respectively. Mortality was documented in (8%; n = 5) of the patients while 68% (n = 43) of the study cohort recovered. Mortality was associated with those that were admitted to ICU (19% vs 0; p = 0.009), mechanically ventilated (31% vs 0; p = 0.001), had DM (20% vs 2.3%; p = 0.032), older (62 vs 47 years; p = 0.045), had high total bilirubin (43% vs 2.3%; p = 0.007) and those with high C-reactive protein (186 vs 90 mg/dL; p = 0.009) and low corrected calcium (15% vs 0%; p = 0.047). Conclusions: ICU admission, those on mechanical ventilation, the elderly, those with high total bilirubin and low corrected calcium were associated with high mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. © 2020 The Author(s)","Clinical characteristics; COVID 19; Oman; Outcomes; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team (2020) Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi, 41 (2), pp. 145-151; Gg Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; Chan, J.F., Kok, K.H., Zhu, Z., Chu, H., To, K.K., Yuan, S., Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9 (1), pp. 221-236; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733; (2020), https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19—20-march-2020, WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19: 11th March 2020.

A previously healthy 40-year-old man was admitted to the hospital 3 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms including dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath progressing to intubation and increased mechanical ventilator support. A request for compassionate use remdesivir was submitted on the same hospital day as the positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction result. Supportive measures, in addition to a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, were maintained until remdesivir could be supplied on day 9 of hospitalization, 13 days after symptom onset. Sixty hours after initiating remdesivir, the patient was successfully extubated and able to transition to room air within 24 hours of extubation. Late initiation of remdesivir may be effective in treating SARS-CoV-2, unlike antivirals utilized for different disease states, such as oseltamivir, that are most effective when started as soon as possible following symptom onset. Urgent action is needed by regulatory agencies to work with drug manufacturers to expedite the study and approval of investigational agents targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as to meet manufacturing demands. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","coronavirus;

Concomitant administration of antiviral agents has the potential to increase their plasma concentration. A series of patients managed in the Cremona Thrombosis Center were admitted at Cremona Hospital for SARS-CoV-2 and started antiviral drugs without stopping DOAC therapy. DOAC plasma levels were measured in hospital and results compared with those recorded before hospitalization. Methods: All consecutive patients on DOACs were candidates for administration of antiviral agents (lopinavir, ritonavir, or darunavir). Plasma samples for DOAC measurement were collected 2to 4 days after starting antiviral treatment, at 12 hours from the last dose intake in patients on dabigatran and apixaban, and at 24 hours in those on rivaroxaban and edoxaban. For each patient, C-trough DOAC level, expressed as ng/mL, was compared with the one measured before hospitalization. Results: Of the 1039 patients hospitalized between February 22 and March 15, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia and candidates for antiviral therapy, 32 were on treatment with a DOAC. DOAC was stopped in 20 and continued in the remaining 12. On average, C-trough levels were 6.14 times higher during hospitalization than in the pre-hospitalization period. Conclusion: DOAC patients treated with antiviral drugs show an alarming increase in DOAC plasma levels. In order to prevent bleeding complications, we believe that physicians should consider withholding DOACs from patients with SARS-CoV-2 and replacing them with alternative parenteral antithrombotic strategies for as long as antiviral agents are deemed necessary and until discharge. © 2020 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis","anticoagulant; antiviral agents; COVID-19; DOAC; plasma level","apixaban; azithromycin; dabigatran; darunavir plus ritonavir; edoxaban; hydroxychloroquine; levofloxacin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; rivaroxaban; antithrombin; antivirus agent; apixaban; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; dabigatran; darunavir; edoxaban; lopinavir; pyrazole derivative; pyridine derivative; pyridone derivative; ritonavir; thiazole derivative; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug blood level; drug withdrawal; female; hospitalization; human; human cell; male; minimum plasma concentration; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment withdrawal; very elderly; Betacoronavirus; bleeding; blood; comparative study; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug interaction; drug monitoring; Italy; oral drug administration; pandemic; pathogenicity; patient safety; risk assessment; risk factor; severity of illness index; virology; virus pneumonia; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antithrombins; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Dabigatran; Darunavir; Drug Interactions; Drug Monitoring; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Hemorrhage; Humans; Italy; Lopinavir; Male; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pneumonia, Viral; Pyrazoles; Pyridines; Pyridones; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Ritonavir; Severity of Illness Index; Thiazoles",,"apixaban, 503612-47-3; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; edoxaban, 480449-70-5, 480449-71-6, 912273-65-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; rivaroxaban, 366789-02-8; antithrombin, 9000-94-6; darunavir, 206361-99-1, 635728-49-3; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; pyridone derivative, 694-85-9; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; Antithrombins; Antiviral Agents; apixaban; Dabigatran; Darunavir; edoxaban; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Lopinavir; Pyrazoles; Pyridines; Pyridones; Ritonavir; Thiazoles",,,,,,"Phelan, A.L., Katz, R., Gostin, L.O., The novel coronavirus originating in wuhan, china: challenges for global health governance (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), p. 709; (2020) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 51; Ageno, W., Gallus, A.S., Wittkowsky, A., Crowther, M., Hylek, E.M., Palareti, G., Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American college of chest physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2012) Chest, 141, pp. e44S-88S; Holbrook, A., Schulman, S., Witt, D.M., Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American college of chest physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2012) Chest, 141 (2), pp. e152S-e184S; Testa, S., Tripodi, A., Legnani, C., Plasma levels of direct oral anticoagulants in real life patients with atrial fibrillation: Results observed in four anticoagulation clinics (2016) Thromb Res, 137, pp. 178-183; Reilly, P.A., Lehr, T., Haertter, S., The effect of dabigatran plasma concentrations and patient characteristics on the frequency of ischemic stroke and major bleeding in atrial fibrillation patients: the RE-LY Trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) (2014) J Am Coll Cardiol, 63 (4), pp. 321-328; Pradaxa - summary of product characteristics, , http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-Product_Information/human/000829/WC500041059.pdf, Accessed 26 September 2017; Xarelto - Summary of product characteristics, , http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/000944/WC500057108.pdf, Accessed 26 September 2017; Eliquis - Summary of product characteristics, , http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002148/WC500107728.pdf, Accessed 26 September 2017; Lixiana - summary of product characteristics, , http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/002629/WC500189045.pdf, European Medicines Agency.

The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR 5–12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI) 0.55 (0.37–0.82) p = 0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90%, and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.54 (0.36–0.82) p = 0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR 0.42 (0.26–0.66) p < 0.001. The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus infections; Covid-19; Heparin; Mortality; Pulmonary embolism; Thrombosis",,,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We analyzed a case series of COVID-19-positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc ≥500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc ≥550 ms (if QRS ≥120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of ≥60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19-positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 62±17 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 448±29 ms and increased to 459±36 ms (P=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (18±43 ms versus -0.2±28 ms in women; P=0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (17±39 ms versus 0.5±40 ms; P=0.07). No patients manifested torsades de pointes. Conclusions Overall, 12% of patients manifested critical QTc prolongation, and the combination caused greater prolongation than either drug alone. The balance between uncertain benefit and potential risk when treating COVID-19 patients should be carefully assessed.","azithromycin; COVID‐19; hydroxychloroquine; monitoring; QT interval",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,20479980,,,"32463348","English","J Am Heart Assoc",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086524129

A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication. Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anti-viral drugs; Chloroquine; Pneumocytes; RNA dependent RNA polymerase; SARS-CoV-2; Zinc transporter",,,,,,,,,"Hui, D.S., Memish, Z.A., Zumla, A., Severe acute respiratory syndrome vs. the Middle East respiratory syndrome (2014) Curr Opin Pulm Med, 20, pp. 233-241; Su, S., Wong, G., Shi, W., Liu, J., Lai, A.C.K., Zhou, J., Liu, W., Gao, G.F., Epidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses (2016) Trends Microbiol, 24, pp. 490-502; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Zhao, X., Tan, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Forni, D., Cagliani, R., Clerici, M., Sironi, M., Molecular evolution of human coronavirus genomes (2017) Trends Microbiol, 25, pp. 35-48; Cheng, V.C.C., Lau, S.K.P., Woo, P.C.Y., Yuen, K.Y., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as an agent of emerging and reemerging infection (2007) Clin Microbiol Rev, 20, pp. 660-694; Wu, A., Peng, Y., Huang, B., Ding, X., Wang, X., Niu, P., Meng, J., Jiang, T., Genome composition and divergence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in China (2020) Cell Host Microbe, 27, pp. 325-328; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 565-574; Wrapp, D., Wang, N., Corbett, K.S., Goldsmith, J.A., Hsieh, C.L., Abiona, O., Graham, B.S., McLellan, J.S., Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation (2020) Science, 367, pp. 1260-1263; Ou, X., Liu, Y., Lei, X., Li, P., Mi, D., Ren, L., Guo, L., Qian, Z., Characterization of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on virus entry and its immune cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV (2020) Nat Commun, 11, p. 1620; Liu, L., Wei, Q., Alvarez, X., Wang, H., du, Y., Zhu, H., Jiang, H., Chen, Z., Epithelial cells lining salivary gland ducts are early target cells of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in the upper respiratory tracts of rhesus macaques (2011) J Virol, 85, pp. 4025-4030; Kuba, K., Imai, Y., Rao, S., Gao, H., Guo, F., Guan, B., Huan, Y., Penninger, J.M., A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury (2005) Nat Med, 11, pp. 875-879; Fehr, A.R., Perlman, S., Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis (2015) Methods Mol Biol, 1282, pp. 1-23; Perlman, S., Netland, J., Coronaviruses post-SARS: update on replication and pathogenesis (2009) Nat Rev Microbiol, 7, pp. 439-450; Morse, J.S., Lalonde, T., Xu, S., Liu, W.R., Learning from the past: possible urgent prevention and treatment options for severe acute respiratory infections caused by 2019-nCoV (2020) Chembiochem, 21, pp. 730-738; Devaux, C.A., Rolain, J.-M., Colson, P., Raoult, D., New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?

There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease. Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature. Methods: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020. The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted. Results: A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions. Conclusion: The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations. Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Clinical prudence is required in advocating HCQ as a therapeutic armamentarium in COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/, Countries where Coronavirus has spread—Worldometer, Accessed 10 May 2020; Sahu, K.K., Mishra, A.K., Lal, A., COVID-2019: update on epidemiology, disease spread and management (2020) Monaldi Arch Chest Dis Arch Monaldi Mal Torace; Devaux, C.A., Rolain, J.-M., Colson, P., Raoult, D., New insights on the antiviral effects of chloroquine against coronavirus: what to expect for COVID-19?

To understand the impact on transplant activity across the US, and center-level variation in testing, clinical practice, and policies, we conducted a national survey between March 24-31, 2020 and linked responses to the COVID-19 incidence map. Response rate was a very high 79.3%, reflecting a strong national priority to better understand COVID-19. Complete suspension of live donor kidney transplantation was reported by 71.8% and live donor liver by 67.7%. While complete suspension of deceased donor transplantation was less frequent, some restrictions to deceased donor kidney transplantation were reported by 84.0% and deceased donor liver by 73.3%; more stringent restrictions were associated with higher regional incidence of COVID-19. Shortage of COVID-19 tests was reported by 42.5%. Respondents reported a total of 148 COVID-19 recipients from <1y to >10y post-transplant: 69.6% were kidney recipients, and 25.0% were critically ill. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was used by 78.1% of respondents; azithromycin by 46.9%; tocilizumab by 31.3%, and remdesivir by 25.0%. There is wide heterogeneity in center-level response across the US; ongoing national data collection, expert discussion, and clinical studies are critical to informing evidence-based practices.

Few data are available for the outcome of pregnancy complicated by serious respiratory disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim: We herein report a series of four neonates whose mothers had recovered from new coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women with documented COVID-19 infection during their pregnancy, who gave birth in Parma Hospital, University of Parma, Italy, in March and April 2020, during the peak of incidence of COVID-19 in Italy. Clinical records and laboratory tests were retrospectively reviewed. Results: All neonates were delivered at term in good conditions without congenital COVID-19 infection. Conclusions: Findings from our series of cases indicated that adverse effects on foetuses from pregnancies complicated by COVID-19 infection in late pregnancy are unlikely. © Mattioli 1885.","Covid19; Newborn infants; Pregnancy; Viral recovery","azithromycin; ceftriaxone; enoxaparin; levofloxacin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amnion fluid; anosmia; Article; asthenia; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; echography; female; fever; Gardnerella vaginalis; human; interstitial pneumonia; malaise; metrorrhagia; newborn; noninvasive ventilation; positive end expiratory pressure; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; third trimester pregnancy; vaginal delivery; virus detection; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; laboratory technique; mother; pandemic; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; vertical transmission; virology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Mothers; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0",,,,,,"Schwartz, D.A., An Analysis of 38 Pregnant Women with COVID-19, Their Newborn Infants, and Maternal-Fetal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: Maternal Coronavirus Infections and Pregnancy Outcomes (2020) Arch Pathol Lab Med; Zeng, L., Xia, S., Yuan, W., Yan, K., Xiao, F., Shao, J., Neonatal Early-Onset Infection With SARS-CoV-2 in 33 Neonates Born to Mothers With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Pediatr; Yu, N., Li, W., Kang, Q., Xiong, Z., Wang, S., Lin, X., Clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective, single-centre, descriptive study (2020) Lancet Infect Dis; Zhu, H., Wang, L., Fang, C., Peng, S., Zhang, L., Chang, G., Clinical analysis of 10 neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia (2020) Transl Pediatr, 9 (1), pp. 51-60; Alzamora, M.C., Paredes, T., Caceres, D., Webb, C.M., Valdez, L.M., La Rosa, M., Severe COVID-19 during Pregnancy and Possible Vertical Transmission (2020) Am J Perinatol; Zamaniyan, M., Ebadi, A., Aghajanpoor Mir, S., Rahmani, Z., Haghshenas, M., Azizi, S., Preterm delivery in pregnant woman with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and vertical transmission (2020) Prenat Diagn; Nalla, A.K., Casto, A.M., Huang, M.W., Perchetti, G.A., Sampoleo, R., Shrestha, L., Wei, Y., Greninger, A.L., Comparative Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Detection Assays using Seven Different Primer/Probe Sets and One Assay Kit (Published online ahead of print, 2020 Apr 8) (2020) J Clin Microbiol; Nuzum, J.W., Pilot, I., Stangl, F.H., Bonar, B.E., 1918 pandemic influenza and pneumonia in a large civil hospital (1976) IMJ Ill Med J, 150 (6), pp. 612-616; Breslin, N., Baptiste, C., Gyamfi-Bannerman, C., Miller, R., Martinez, R., Bernstein, K., COVID-19 infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women: Two weeks of confirmed presentations to an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals (2020) Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM; Zaigham, M., Ersson, O., Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes with COVID-19: A systematic review of 108 pregnancies (2020) Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand","Perrone, S.; Neonatology Unit, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of ParmaItaly; email: serafina.perrone@unipr.it",,,"Mattioli 1885",,,,,03924203,,ATPRA,"32420961","English","Acta Biomed.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084943708

The COVID-19 pandemic has altered routine standard of care practice and the acute management particularly for those patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, where pulmonary arterial hypertension-specific treatments are used. It is important to balance the ongoing care and evaluation of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with “exposure risk” to COVID-19 for patients coming to clinic or the hospital. If there is a morbidity and mortality benefit from starting pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, for example in a patient with high-likelihood of pulmonary arterial hypertension, then it remains important to complete the thorough evaluation. However, the COVID-19 outbreak may also represent a unique time when pulmonary hypertension experts have to weigh the risks and benefits of the diagnostic work-up including potential exposure to COVID-19 versus initiating targeted pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy in a select high-risk, high likelihood World Symposium Pulmonary Hypertension Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. This document will highlight some of the issues facing providers, patients, and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in real-time as the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and is intended to share expected common clinical scenarios and best clinical practices to help the community at-large. © The Author(s) 2020.","clinical trials; mechanical ventilation; prostacyclin; pulmonary hypertension; right heart failure; therapeutics","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; azithromycin; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; low molecular weight heparin; riociguat; selexipag; warfarin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular risk; China; clinical evaluation; clinical practice; clinical trial (topic); computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; echocardiography; education; emergency physician; endarterectomy; extracorporeal oxygenation; health care; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care quality; heart arrest; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle failure; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; international normalized ratio; medical research; morbidity; mortality; myocarditis; pandemic; patient care; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; prevalence; public health; pulmonary artery occlusion; pulmonary hypertension; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; telemedicine; valvular heart disease; venous thromboembolism; wellbeing; World Health Organization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; riociguat, 625115-55-1; selexipag, 475086-01-2; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2",,,,"Dr Ryan and his research is supported by funding from The Reagan Corporation, The Gordon Family, and The Cushman Family.",,"https://who.int/dg/speeches/detail/whodirector-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19, (accessed 11 March 2020; Li, B., Yang, J., Zhao, F., Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China Clin Res Cardiol, , Epub ahead of print: 11 March 2020; Driggin, E., Madhavan, M.V., Bikdeli, B., Cardiovascular Considerations for Patients, Health Care Workers, and Health Systems During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID-19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36-year-old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID-19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug-to-drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56-year-old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO-incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.

There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

However, evidence of efficacy remains limited, and adverse events can be associated with its use. Here, we report a case of a patient with severe COVID-19 who, after being administered HCQ, exhibited a 10-fold increase in serum levels of transaminases, followed by a rapid decrease after HCQ was withdrawn. Considering the significantly increased use of HCQ during the COVID-19 pandemic, this case alerts us to the potential for HCQ to be associated with hepatotoxicity and the need to monitor liver function during HCQ therapy.

Its pathological effect is majorly in the respiratory tract, but its full pathogenicity remains a mystery. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some patients develop other symptoms like diarrhea. However, it is possible for other organs to be affected including the central nervous system, liver, and blood cells. The purpose of this case series is to unravel other factors associated with this disease, so we report three cases of COVID-19 that were hospitalized during the pandemic. © 2020 Muhammed Atere et al.",,"aciclovir; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; azithromycin; ceftriaxone; doxycycline; hydroxychloroquine; levofloxacin; paracetamol; vancomycin; adult; aged; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; asthma; blood cell count; bronchitis; case report; case study; clinical article; clinical laboratory; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; faintness; fever; hospital patient; human; hypertension; laboratory test; male; medical history; middle aged; nose smear; pandemic; physical examination; pneumonia; pulse oximetry; risk factor; seizure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; statistically significant result; symptom; thorax pain; thorax radiography; urinalysis; vomiting",,"aciclovir, 59277-89-3; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 74469-00-4, 79198-29-1; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; doxycycline, 10592-13-9, 17086-28-1, 564-25-0, 94088-85-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; paracetamol, 103-90-2; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China The Lancet, 395 (2020), pp. 497-506; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (8), pp. 727-733; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern The Lancet, 395 (2020), pp. 470-473; Carlos, W.G., Dela Cruz, C.S., Cao, B., Pasnick, S., Jamil, S., Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus (2020) American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, 201 (4), pp. P7-P8; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19): Cases, Data, & Surveillance, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA; Wu, A., Peng, Y., Huang, B., Genome composition and divergence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in China (2020) Cell Host & Microbe, 27 (3), pp. 325-328; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (1), pp. 1-13; Zhang, J., Zhou, L., Yang, Y., Peng, W., Wang, W., Chen, X., Therapeutic and triage strategies for 2019 novel coronavirus disease in fever clinics (2020) The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 8 (3), pp. e11-e12; Chang, D., Xu, H., Rebaza, A., Sharma, L., Dela Cruz, C.S., Protecting health-care workers from subclinical coronavirus infection (2020) The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, 8 (3), p. e13; Holshue, M.L., Debolt, C., Lindquist, S., First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (10), pp. 929-936; Rothe, C., Schunk, M., Sothmann, P., Transmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (10), pp. 971-970; Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update, 2020. , https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-Announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-daily-roundup-may-1-2020, United States Food Drug Administration FDA Silver Spring MA USA; Colson, P., Rolain, J.M., Lagier, J.C., Brouqui, P., Raoult, D., Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as available weapons to fight COVID-19 International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 55 (4), p. 2020; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-: How to Protect Yourself, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019cov/prepare/prevention.html.4, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA, 2020","Atere, M.; Richmond University Medical Center, 355 Bard Avenue, United States; email: matere@rumcsi.org",,,"Hindawi Limited",,,,,16879627,,,,"English","Case Rep.

It has been speculated that patients with comorbidities and elderly patients could be at high risk for the pandemic reasoned respiratory insufficiency and death. At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications. However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis. Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. Methods: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with type 1 interferon for multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. Results: Despite using immunmodulator, the symptoms of the patient at hospitalization were mild and he did not show elevated D-dimer, and there was no lymphopenia. He was discharged to home-quarantine with no symptoms. Discussion: This report supports the idea of using type 1 interferon in the treatment could be effective in COVID-19 affected patients. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"azithromycin; beta interferon; D dimer; enoxaparin; hydroxychloroquine; adult; allergic rhinitis; Article; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease course; dyspnea; human; length of stay; male; multiple sclerosis; polymerase chain reaction; quarantine; throat culture; virus pneumonia",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Cao, B., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet Lond.

The patient traveled from Wuhan, Hubei, China, to Thailand in January 2020. One of her family members was diagnosed with COVID-19. She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms. Three days earlier, her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results. A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis in this patient was facilitated by chest imaging and repeat viral testing.

We have studied 10 patients treated at 12 adult care hospitals. Ten kidney transplant recipients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by polymerase chain reaction, and 9 were admitted. The median age was 57 (interquartile range [IQR] 47-67), 60% were male, 40% Caucasian, and 30% Black/African American. Median time from transplant to COVID-19 testing was 2822 days (IQR 1272-4592). The most common symptom was fever, followed by cough, myalgia, chills, and fatigue. The most common chest X-ray and computed tomography abnormality was multifocal patchy opacities. Three patients had no abnormal findings. Leukopenia was seen in 20% of patients, and allograft function was stable in 50% of patients. Nine patients were on tacrolimus and a mycophenolic antimetabolite, and 70% were on prednisone. Hospitalized patients had their antimetabolite agent stopped. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Three patients died (30%), and 5 (50%) developed acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 should be monitored closely in the setting of lowered immunosuppression. Most individuals required hospitalization and presenting symptoms were similar to those of nontransplant individuals. © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","clinical research/practice; infection and infectious agents - viral; kidney (allograft) function/dysfunction; kidney transplantation/nephrology",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017; Guillen, E., Pineiro, G.J., Revuelta, I., Case report of COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient: Does immunosuppression alter the clinical presentation Am J Transplant, , https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15874, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Zhu, L., Xu, X., Ma, K., Successful recovery of COVID-19 pneumonia in a renal transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppression Am J Transplant, , https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15869, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Wu, C., Chen, X., Cai, Y., Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Intern Med, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994, [Epub ahead of print]; Zhang, H., Chen, Y., Yuan, Q., Identification of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (2020) Eur Urol, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.030, [Epub ahead of print]; Alberici, F., Delbarba, E., Manenti, C., Management of patients on dialysis and with kidney transplant during SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in Brescia, Italy (2020) Kidney Int Rep, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2020.04.001, [Epub ahead of print]; D'Antiga, L., Coronaviruses and immunosuppressed patients.

The disease was named COVID-19 standing for coronavirus disease 2019. The objectives were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this prospective descriptive study, 15 confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 between 18th March and April 7, 2020 were followed-up till discharge. Results: There were 15 reported patients infected by 3 imported index cases from Europe. The mean age of the patients was 28.06 (SD: 16.42 years). The patients’ age stratification was as follows: 0–5 (2, 13.3%); 6–18 (2, 13.3); 19–50 (10, 66.7%), and 51–64 years (1, 6.7%). The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%). Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%). The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%). All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days. The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21). Conclusion: All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission. The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery. © 2020 Diabetes India","Clinical manifestations; Infection; Respiratory disorders","antibiotic agent; azithromycin; hemoglobin; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; adolescent; adult; Article; child; chill; clinical article; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; disease severity; dyspnea; epidemiological data; Europe; fatigue; female; fever; hematological parameters; human; Iraqi Kurdistan; laboratory test; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; male; middle aged; neutrophil count; platelet count; pneumonia; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; radiological parameters; rhinorrhea; school child; smelling disorder; sore throat; taste disorder; young adult",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8",,,,"We would like to thank the staff of the corona hospital who are on the frontline for managing COVID-19 patients.

Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined. Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses. Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations. Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts. Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.

The clinical sequelae vary from mild, self-limiting upper respiratory infection symptoms to severe respiratory distress, acute cardiopulmonary arrest and death. Otolaryngologists around the globe have reported a significant number of mild or otherwise asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 presenting with olfactory dysfunction. We present a case of COVID-19 resulting in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, presenting with the initial symptom of disrupted taste and flavour perception prior to respiratory involvement. After 4 days in the ICU and 6 days on the general medicine floor, our patient regained a majority of her sense of smell and was discharged with only lingering dysgeusia. In this paper, we review existing literature and the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the reported symptoms of hyposmia, hypogeusia and dysgeusia. © © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

No vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus, however, some drugs that are indicated for other afflictions seems to be potentially beneficial to treat the infection albeit without unequivocal evidence. The aim of this article is to review the published background on the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19 Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted on recently published studies which have published between January 1 to March 25, 2020. PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct databases were searched Results: A total 22 articles were found eligible. 8 discuss about treatment outcomes from their applied drugs during treatment of COVID-19 patients, 4 report laboratory tests, one report animal trial and other 9 articles discuss recommendations and suggestions based on the treatment process and clinical outcomes of other diseases such as malaria, ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The data and/or recommendations are categorized in 4 classes: (a) anti-viral and anti-inflammatory drugs, (b) anti-malaria drugs, (c) traditional Chinese drugs and (d) other treatments/drugs. Conclusion: All examined treatments, although potentiality effective against COVID-19, need either appropriate drug development or clinical trial to be suitable for clinical use. © 2020, Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences.

Zhang, T.; Zimmer, A.J.; West, J.; COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium","Background: Data on patients with COVID-19 who have cancer are lacking. Here we characterise the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 and identify potential prognostic factors for mortality and severe illness. Methods: In this cohort study, we collected de-identified data on patients with active or previous malignancy, aged 18 years and older, with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from the USA, Canada, and Spain from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) database for whom baseline data were added between March 17 and April 16, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical conditions, medications, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 disease course. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 days of diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed the association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables using logistic regression analyses, partially adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and obesity. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing. Findings: Of 1035 records entered into the CCC19 database during the study period, 928 patients met inclusion criteria for our analysis. Median age was 66 years (IQR 57–76), 279 (30%) were aged 75 years or older, and 468 (50%) patients were male. The most prevalent malignancies were breast (191 [21%]) and prostate (152 [16%]). 366 (39%) patients were on active anticancer treatment, and 396 (43%) had active (measurable) cancer. At analysis (May 7, 2020), 121 (13%) patients had died. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with increased 30-day mortality, after partial adjustment, were: increased age (per 10 years; partially adjusted odds ratio 1·84, 95% CI 1·53–2·21), male sex (1·63, 1·07–2·48), smoking status (former smoker vs never smoked: 1·60, 1·03–2·47), number of comorbidities (two vs none: 4·50, 1·33–15·28), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or higher (status of 2 vs 0 or 1: 3·89, 2·11–7·18), active cancer (progressing vs remission: 5·20, 2·77–9·77), and receipt of azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine (vs treatment with neither: 2·93, 1·79–4·79; confounding by indication cannot be excluded). Compared with residence in the US-Northeast, residence in Canada (0·24, 0·07–0·84) or the US-Midwest (0·50, 0·28–0·90) were associated with decreased 30-day all-cause mortality. Race and ethnicity, obesity status, cancer type, type of anticancer therapy, and recent surgery were not associated with mortality. Interpretation: Among patients with cancer and COVID-19, 30-day all-cause mortality was high and associated with general risk factors and risk factors unique to patients with cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to better understand the effect of COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with cancer, including the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.

Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS. © 2020 The Authors.

The optimal dosing of HCQ is unknown. Our goal was to integrate historic and emerging pharmacological and toxicity data to understand safe and efficacious HCQ dosing strategies for COVID-19 treatment. The data sources included were 1) longitudinal clinical, pharmacokinetic, and virologic data from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who received HCQ with or without azithromycin (n=116), 2) in vitro viral replication data and SARS-CoV-2 viral load inhibition by HCQ, 3) a population pharmacokinetic model of HCQ and 4) a model relating chloroquine pharmacokinetics to QTc prolongation. A mechanistic PK/virologic/QTc model for HCQ was developed and externally validated to predict SARS-CoV-2 rate of viral decline and QTc prolongation. SARS-CoV-2 viral decline was associated with HCQ pharmacokinetics (p&lt;0.001). The extrapolated patient EC50 was 4.7 µM, comparable to the reported in vitro EC50’s. HCQ doses &gt; 400 mg BID for ≥5 days were predicted to rapidly decrease viral loads, reduce the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and shorten treatment courses, compared to lower dose (≤400 mg daily) regimens. However, HCQ doses &gt;600 mg BID were also predicted to prolong QTc intervals. This prolongation may have clinical implications warranting further safety assessment. Due to COVID-19’s variable natural history, lower dose HCQ regimens may be indistinguishable from controls. Evaluation of higher HCQ doses is needed to ensure adequate safety and efficacy.

Covid-19 infection is a multisystem disease more frequent in older individuals, especially in those with multiple chronic diseases. This multimorbid and frail population requires attention and a personalized comprehensive assessment in order to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes. As other diseases, the COVID-19 presentation in older patients is often atypical with less severe and unspecific symptoms. These subjects both at home and during hospitalization suffer isolation and the lack of support of caregivers. The geriatric care in COVID-19 wards is often missing. The application of additional instruments would be necessary to facilitate and personalize the clinical approach, not only based on diseases but also on functional status. This narrative review starts from diagnostic evaluation, continues with adapted pharmacologic treatment and ends with the recovery phase targeting the nutrition and physical exercise. We developed a check-list of respiratory, gastrointestinal and other less-specific symptoms, summarized in a table and easily to be filled-up by patients, nurses and general practitioners. As second step, we reported the clinical phases of this disease. Far to be considered just viral infective and respiratory, this disease is also an inflammatory and thrombotic condition with frequent bacterial over-infection. We finally considered timing and selection of treatment, which depend on the disease phase, co-administration of other drugs and require the monitoring of renal, liver and cardiac function. This underlines the role of age not just as a limitation, but also an opportunity to increase the quality and the appropriateness of multidisciplinary and multidimensional intervention in this population.

Since then, the disease has affected about 700 persons in the country. The purpose of our study was to report epidemiological, clinical, radiological and therapeutic features of patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted in the pneumology department. Methods: We extracted the data of the consequetive 20 patients managed in the department of pneumology B at Abderrahmen Mami hospital, from March, 26 to April, 8, 2020. Results: The median age was 61 years old [41-85]. There were 9 men and 11 women. Underlying disorders were observed in 16 patients (80%). Five patients were health care workers. Three patients did not have any known exposure. Common symptoms included fever (100%), shortness of breath (70%) and cough (70%). Computed tomography scans showed bilateral ground glass opacities in 7/9 cases. Fifteen patients received both chloroquine and azithromycin. Fourteen patients (70%) were discharged before April, 8, 2020. Reported complications were: hypokalemia (3 cases), pulmonary embolism (2 cases) and QT prolongation (1 case). One patient died from acute cardiac injury. Conclusion: Knowing the different aspects of moderate and severe forms of the disease can contribute to advance in infection control strategies. © 2020, Maison du Medicine.

Infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus leads to the COVID-19 disease which can be fatal, especially in older patients with medical co-morbidities. The impact to the US healthcare system has been disruptive, and the way healthcare services are provided has changed drastically. Here, we present a compilation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric care in the US, in the various settings: outpatient, emergency room, inpatient units, consultation services, and the community. We further present effects seen on psychiatric physicians in the setting of new and constantly evolving protocols where adjustment and flexibility have become the norm, training of residents, leading a team of professionals with different expertise, conducting clinical research, and ethical considerations. The purpose of this paper is to provide examples of “how to” processes based on our current front-line experiences and research to practicing psychiatrists and mental health clinicians, inform practitioners about national guidelines affecting psychiatric care during the pandemic, and inform health care policy makers and health care systems about the challenges and continued needs of financial and administrative support for psychiatric physicians and mental health systems. © 2020",,"azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; remdesivir; clinical practice; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency ward; financial management; health care policy; health care system; hospital patient; human; liaison psychiatry; medical education; mental health care; outpatient care; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; psychiatrist; Review; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; telehealth; United States",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3",,,,,,"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/withholding-information-patients, American Medical Association.

We herein report our initial experience with solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two centers during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in New York City. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age of 57 years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, and 27 (30%) severe disease. Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases. As this outbreak unfolds, COVID-19 has the potential to severely impact solid organ transplant recipients. © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","antibiotic: antiviral; clinical research/practice; complication: infectious; immunosuppression/immune modulation; infection and infectious agents – viral; infectious disease; organ transplantation in general",,,,,,,,,"Holshue, M.L., DeBolt, C., Lindquist, S., First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (10), pp. 929-936; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Porcheddu, R., Serra, C., Kelvin, D., Similarity in case fatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 in Italy and China (2020) J Infect Dev Ctries, 14 (2), pp. 125-128; Arentz, M., Yim, E., Klaff, L., Characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4326, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) JAMA, 323 (13), p. 1239; Onder, G., Rezza, G., Brusaferro, S., Case-fatality rate and characteristics of patients dying in relation to COVID-19 in Italy JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4683, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Michaels, M.G., La Hoz, R.M., Danziger-Isakov, L., Coronavirus disease 2019: implications of emerging infections for transplantation Am J Transplant, , https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15832, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Guillen, E., Pineiro, G.J., Revuelta, I., Case report of COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient: does immunosuppression alter the clinical presentation?

However, no systematic review and meta-analysis have addressed the issue of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in coronavirus disease 2019. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of “time to clinical cure,” “virological cure,” “death or clinical worsening of disease,” “radiological progression,” and safety. RevMan was used for meta-analysis. We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review. In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in “time to body temperature normalization” and one study reported less “cough days” in the HCQ arm. Treatment with HCQ resulted in less number of cases showing the radiological progression of lung disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.9). No difference was observed in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95% CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.37-21.97), and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18), when compared with the control/conventional treatment. Five studies reported either the safety or efficacy of HCQ + azithromycin. Although seems safe and effective, more data are required for a definitive conclusion. HCQ seems to be promising in terms of less number of cases with radiological progression with a comparable safety profile to control/conventional treatment. We need more data to come to a definite conclusion. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; hydroxychloroquine; meta-analysis; SARS CoV-2","azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; blurred vision;

This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia, notably, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir. During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available. © 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society",,,,,,,"Biosense Webster

Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods: Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of ≥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results: Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions: HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; QT prolongation; SARS-CoV-2; Torsades de Pointes",,,,,,,,,"Savarino, A., Boelaert, J.R., Cassone, A., Majori, G., Cauda, R., Effects of chloroquine on viral infections: an old drug against today's diseases?

As protective immunity does not exist in humans and the virus is capable of escaping innate immune responses, it can proliferate, unhindered, in primarily infected tissues. Subsequent cell death results in the release of virus particles and intracellular components to the extracellular space, which result in immune cell recruitment, the generation of immune complexes and associated damage. Infection of monocytes/macrophages and/or recruitment of uninfected immune cells can result in massive inflammatory responses later in the disease. Uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory mediators contributes to ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome. Antiviral agents and immune modulating treatments are currently being trialled. Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"azithromycin; biological marker; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; cytokine receptor antagonist; host factor; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunomodulating agent; interferon; Janus kinase inhibitor; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nucleoside analog; recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2; recombinant enzyme; remdesivir; unclassified drug; acute lung injury; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antigen antibody complex; antiviral activity; antiviral therapy; case fatality rate; clinical feature; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine response; cytokine storm; host range; human; immune evasion; immunocompetent cell; immunology; immunomodulation; immunopathology; immunotherapy; infection risk; innate immunity; macrophage; monocyte; mortality rate; nonhuman; pandemic; phenotype; plasma; priority journal; protein expression; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survivor; vaccination; viral clearance; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus load; virus morphology; virus replication",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3",,,,,,"Song, Z., Xu, Y., Bao, L., Zhang, L., Yu, P., Qu, Y., From SARS to MERS, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight (2019) Viruses, 11 (1); Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Preiser, W., van der Werf, S., Brodt, H.R., Becker, S., Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N.

The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Most patients have a good prognosis while some with severe conditions could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even die. The exacerbation of the patient's condition may be due to a cytokine storm in the body. Effective targeted therapies including antiviral and immunization are urgently needed. Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently. We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral; COVID-19; Immunization; Therapy","alpha interferon; arbidol; azithromycin; Chinese drug; chloroquine; corticosteroid; favipiravir; huashibaidufang; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; jinhua qinggan; lianhua qingwen; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; placebo; qingfeipaidu; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; xuanfeibaidufang; xuebijing; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood clotting disorder; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; disease severity; fatigue; fever; human; metabolic acidosis; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; prognosis; QT prolongation; Review; septic shock; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Key Medical Subjects of Jiangsu Province: ZDRCA2016019

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) was first reported in China, with bats as the likely original hosts and pangolins as potential intermediate hosts. The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection. The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first. Among them, elderly men with underlying diseases had a higher mortality rate. Chinese medical staff have summarized a set of effective strategies and methods in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease that are worthy of reference for their international counterparts. With powerful government intervention and the efforts of Chinese medical staff, China's outbreak has gradually improved. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","COVID-19; epidemic; mortality; treatment; virus pneumonia","aciclovir; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; beta interferon; chloroquine; ganciclovir; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrolide; methylprednisolone; monoclonal antibody; oseltamivir; peramivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; virus DNA; zanamivir; antiviral therapy; China; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease course; disease predisposition; epidemic; government; hospital discharge; human; infection prevention; infection risk; laboratory test; mortality rate; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus transmission; virus virulence; vulnerable population",,"aciclovir, 59277-89-3; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; ganciclovir, 82410-32-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; peramivir, 229614-55-5, 229614-56-6, 229615-12-7; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; zanamivir, 139110-80-8",,,,"This study was supported by the Zhejiang University special scientific research fund for COVID-19 prevention and control.",,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395 (10224), pp. 565-574; York, A., Novel coronavirus takes flight from bats?

Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently.

Nurses are in the first line of defence against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are placed in a high-risk situation. This study aimed to report on infection with SARS-CoV-2 during patient care among nures in the Mostafa Khomini Hospital, Ilam, Iran. In this hospital 125 nurses were enrolled in the COVID-19 centre. Five out of 125 nurses (4%) who enrolled in the COVID-19 infection centre, developed COVID-19. They were first positive by real-time PCR but the CT scan was positive for only one of them. None of the infected nurses were hospitalized and all of them preferred to quarantine at home and receive the necessary care and treatment (oseltamivir, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir). This study showed that, regardless of self caring, the nurses were exposed to the virus, because at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran, there was no special protection against this infection, so the nurses were placed at risk. This study also reported that receiving the necessary care and treatment at home was a good experience for nurses and can be used in some cases. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus disease 2019; Covid-19; infection; nurse; SARS-CoV-2","azithromycin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; adult; coronavirus disease 2019; Editorial; eye protection; female; high resolution computer tomography; human; major clinical study; male; nurse; patient care; prevalence; priority journal; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; self care; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8",,,"1399/58","This research is approved by Ilam University of Medical Sciences.

Setting: SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from a 58-year-old man from Wuhan, China who arrived in Melbourne on 19 January 2020 and was admitted to the Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne from the emergency department on 24 January 2020 with fever, cough, and progressive dyspnoea. Major outcomes: Clinical course and laboratory features of the first reported case of COVID-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) in Australia; isolation, whole genome sequencing, imaging, and rapid sharing of virus from the patient. Results: A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum collected when the patient presented to hospital were each positive for SARS-CoV-2 (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Inoculation of Vero/hSLAM cells with material from the nasopharyngeal swab led to the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus in culture. Electron microscopy of the supernatant confirmed the presence of virus particles with morphology characteristic of viruses of the family Coronaviridae. Whole genome sequencing of the viral isolate and phylogenetic analysis indicated the isolate exhibited greater than 99.99% sequence identity with other publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Within 24 hours of isolation, the first Australian SARS-CoV-2 isolate was shared with local and overseas reference laboratories and major North American and European culture collections. Conclusions: The ability to rapidly identify, propagate, and internationally share our SARS-CoV-2 isolate is an important step in collaborative scientific efforts to deal effectively with this international public health emergency by developing better diagnostic procedures, vaccine candidates, and antiviral agents. © 2020 AMPCo Pty Ltd","Public health; Virus diseases","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; azithromycin; C reactive protein; ceftriaxone; gamma glutamyltransferase; oxygen; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; Article; Australian; bacterial pneumonia; blood analysis; case report; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; Coronaviridae; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; differential diagnosis; disease course; dyspnea; electron microscopy; emergency ward; European; fatty liver; fever; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; geographic distribution; heart rate; hepatography; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospital service; human; inoculation; liver function test; lymphocyte count; male; medical history; nonhuman; North American; oxygen saturation; oxygen therapy; phylogeny; protein blood level; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sputum analysis; temperature measurement; thorax radiography; throat culture; treatment response; Vero cell line; virus culture; virus genome; virus isolation; virus morphology; virus particle; whole genome sequencing; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; information dissemination; middle aged; pandemic; patient isolation; procedures; virus pneumonia; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Whole Genome Sequencing",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; alkaline phosphatase, 9001-78-9; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,"National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC

HCSAE, Ciudad de México/México","The pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19 virus has been a global challenge given its high rate of transmission and lack of effective therapy or vaccine. This scenario has led to the use of various drugs that have demonstrated a potential effect against the virus in vitro. However, time has not been enough to properly evaluate their clinical effectiveness. The use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and antiviral treatment and has been proposed by various groups, supported by in-vitro studies and limited patient series, without the adequate scientific rigor that precedes drug prescription. Although it may represent the only hope for many patients, it is important to know the main adverse effects associated with the use of these drugs and to better select patients who may benefit from them. Copyright: © 2020 Permanyer.La pandemia por el virus SARS-COV-2 causante de la enfermedad COVID-19 representa un reto mundial dada su alta tasa de transmisión y ausencia de una terapia efectiva o vacuna. Este escenario ha propiciado el uso de diversos fármacos que in vitro han demostrado un potencial efecto contra el virus. Sin embargo, el tiempo no ha sido suficiente para evaluar su efectividad clínica con el adecuado rigor científico que precede a la prescripción de medicamentos. El uso de cloroquina/hidroxicloroquina, azitromicina y esquemas antivirales ha sido propuesto por diversos grupos, apoyado por series de pacientes limitada en número. Si bien puede representar la única esperanza para muchos enfermos, es importante conocer los principales efectos adversos asociados al uso de estas drogas y seleccionar mejor a los pacientes que puedan beneficiarse de ellas.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. Aim and methods: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. Results: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. Conclusion: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment. © 2020","Anticancer chemotherapy; Children; COVID-19; Immunosuppression","antileukemic agent; antineoplastic agent; azithromycin; cisplatin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; antineoplastic agent; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adjuvant chemotherapy; adolescent; antibiotic therapy; Article; asymptomatic infection; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer therapy; case report; child; childhood cancer; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease course; disease severity; drug withdrawal; Ewing sarcoma; febrile neutropenia; female; fever; flash survey; follow up; hepatoblastoma; high risk patient; human; immunocompromised patient; incidence; infection prevention; maintenance chemotherapy; major clinical study; male; mediastinum cancer; metastasis; methodology; multiple cycle treatment; nephroblastoma; osteosarcoma; pediatric patient; preschool child; priority journal; rhabdoid tumor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment interruption; uterine cervix cancer; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; pandemic; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Antineoplastic Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; cisplatin, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; Antineoplastic Agents",,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China (2019) J Am Med Assoc; Ruan, Q., Yang, K., Wang, W., Jiang, L., Song, J., Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China (2020) Intensive Care Med, , [Epub ahead of print]; Lu, X., Zhang, L., Du, H., Zhang, J., Li, Y.Y., Qu, J., SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (2020) N Engl J Med, , NEJMc2005073; Wei, M., Yuan, J., Liu, Y., Fu, T., Yu, X., Zhang, Z.-J., Novel coronavirus infection in hospitalized infants under 1 Year of age in China (2020) J Am Med Assoc, 129 (6), pp. 802-804; Cai, J., Xu, J., Lin, D., Yang, Z., Xu, L., Qu, Z., A Case Series of children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection: clinical and epidemiological features (2020) Clin Infect Dis, , [Epub ahead of print]; Liu, W., Zhang, Q., Chen, J., Xiang, R., Song, H., Shu, S., Detection of Covid-19 in children in early January 2020 in Wuhan, China (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (14), pp. 1370-1371. , NEJMc2003717; Dong, Y., Mo, X., Hu, Y., Qi, X., Jiang, F., Jiang, Z., Epidemiological characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with 2019 coronavirus disease in China (2020) Pediatrics, , [Epub ahead of print]; Chen, Z., Xiong, H., Li, J.X., Li, H., Tao, F., Yang, Y.T., COVID-19 with post-chemotherapy agranulocytosis in childhood acute leukemia: a case report (2020) Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi, 41, p.

There is limited available knowledge regarding the natural history of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other factors that are also making this infection spread like a pandemic include global travelers, lack of proven treatment, asymptomatic carriers, potential reinfection, underprepared global health care systems, and lack of public awareness and efforts to prevent further spread. It is understood that certain preexisting medical conditions increase the risk of mortality with COVID-19; however, the outcome of this disease in traditionally vulnerable chronic illnesses such as end-stage renal disease is not well documented. We present a case of a 56-year-old African American lady with end-stage renal disease on the peritoneal dialysis who presented predominantly with nausea, vomiting, and subsequently found to have COVID-19.

Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS: We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population. Our current treatment protocol appears to be associated with favorable outcomes, but longer follow-up of a larger cohort of patients is needed.

Neurological problems found in patients with coronavirus infection include: febrile seizures, convulsions, loss of consciousness, encephalomyelitis, and encephalitis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV2. In severe cases, patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute cardiac injury. While seizures and status epilepticus have not been widely reported in the past five months since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with COVID-19 may have hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and severe metabolic and electrolyte disarrangements; hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures to happen in these patients. One should be prepared to treat seizures appropriately, if they happen in a patient who is already in a critical medical condition and suffers from organ failure. © 2020 British Epilepsy Association","Coronavirus;

By describing the life cycle of the newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in light of emerging data on the therapeutic efficacy of various repurposed antimicrobials undergoing testing against the virus, we highlight in this review a possible mechanistic convergence between some of these tested compounds. Specifically, we propose that the lysosomotropic effects of hydroxychloroquine and several other drugs undergoing testing may be responsible for their demonstrated in vitro antiviral activities against COVID-19. Moreover, we propose that Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a lysosomal storage disorder, may provide new insights into potential future therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, by highlighting key established features of the disorder that together result in an “unfavorable” host cellular environment that may interfere with viral propagation. Our reasoning evolves from previous biochemical and cell biology findings related to NPC, coupled with the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19. Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient NPC-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Cardiac aspects of the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are reviewed in this manuscript. A non-systematic review of the medical literature was performed. Information about their safety and efficacy as antimalarials, antivirals, as well as in the long-term treatment of rheumatic diseases was collected. We found an anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of longterm cardiovascular events, a very infrequent heart disease due to a lysosomal effect of the drug, and at the hemodynamic level hypotension, tachycardia, and QT interval prolongation, exacerbated when combined with azithromycin. However, the rate of adverse cardiac events of hydroxychloroquine (and chloroquine) was low.Ante la pandemia de COVID-19 (del inglés coronavirus disease 2019), uno de los fármacos propuesto para su tratamiento es la hidroxicloroquina. Se revisan aquí aspectos cardiológicos del uso de cloroquina e hidroxicloroquina. Se realizó una revisión no sistemática en la literatura médica orientada a la búsqueda de información acerca de su seguridad y eficacia como antimaláricos y antivirales, así como en el tratamiento prolongado de enfermedades reumatológicas. Se halló un efecto antiinflamatorio con reducción de eventos cardiovasculares a largo plazo, una cardiopatía muy infrecuente por un efecto lisosomal del fármaco, y a nivel hemodinámico hipotensión, taquicardia, y prolongación del intervalo QT, exacerbado si se combina con azitromicina. Sin embargo, la tasa de eventos adversos cardíacos de la hidroxicloroquina y la cloroquina fue baja.","azithromycin; cardiovascular system; chloroquine; coronavirus; COVID-19; hydroxychloroquine; long QT syndrome; pandemic","antiinflammatory agent; antirheumatic agent; antivirus agent; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; heart; hemodynamics; human; pandemic; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antirheumatic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Heart; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antirheumatic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Chloroquine; Hydroxychloroquine",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,16699106,,,"32442941","Spanish","Medicina (B Aires)",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085537647

Observations: A 63-year-old male was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), seven days after the beginning of an influenza-like symptoms, to manage an acute respiratory syndrome related with SARS-CoV-2. Chest scan showed interstitial pneumonia with “crazy paving” patterns. At day 19, ocular examination at the patient's bed described petechias and tarsal hemorrhages, mucous filaments and tarsal pseudomembranous. Conjunctival scrapings and swabs did not identify any bacteria or virus. To our knowledge, we described the first case of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 patient. Conclusion and importance: Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is present in tears and conjunctival secretions, external ocular infections could be factors of infectious spreading. Physicians should be aware of late (>2 weeks) ocular complications in COVID-19 patients to prevent sequelae. © 2020 The Authors","Conjunctivitis; COVID-19; External ocular infections; Intensive care unit; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2","artificial tear; azithromycin; dexamethasone; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; adult; Article; artificial ventilation; case report; chemosis; clinical article; conjunctivitis; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; dyspnea; eye examination; hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; human; intensive care; low drug dose; male; middle aged; palpebral conjunctiva; petechia; polymerase chain reaction; pseudomembranous conjunctivitis",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 747-36-4",,,,,,"Morens, D.M., Daszak, P., Taubenberger, J.K., Escaping pandora's box — another novel coronavirus (2020) N Engl J Med, , NEJMp.2002106; Peiris, J.S.M., Yuen, K.Y., Osterhaus, A.D.M.E., Stöhr, K., The severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 349 (25), pp. 2431-2441; Xia, J., Tong, J., Liu, M., Shen, Y., Guo, D., Evaluation of coronavirus in tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (2020) J Med Virol, , jmv.25725; Wu, P., Duan, F., Luo, C., Characteristics of ocular findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hubei province, China (2020) JAMA Ophthalmol; Doherty, M.J., Ocular manifestations of feline infectious peritonitis (1971) J Am Vet Med Assoc, 159 (4), pp. 417-424; van der Hoek, L., Pyrc, K., Jebbink, M.F., Identification of a new human coronavirus (2004) Nat Med, 10 (4), pp. 368-373; Seah, I., Agrawal, R., Can the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affect the eyes?

Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not yet established. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this study shows that the drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. Unexpected molecular similarity is shown between ATM and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, ATM interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by ATM and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. CLQ-OH molecules are shown to saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Taken together, these data show that ATM is directed against the virus, whereas CLQ-OH is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host-cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19. Incidentally, the data also indicate that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Azithromycin; Chloroquine; Coronavirus; Ganglioside;

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2) has rapidly spread worldwide with increasing hospitalization and mortality rate. Ongoing studies and accumulated data are detailing the features and the effects of the new coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) in the adult population, and cardiovascular involvement is emerging as the most significant and life-threatening complication, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. At present, though the limited data on the effects of COVID 19 in pediatric patients, children seem to count for a little proportion of SARS-COV 2 infection, and present with less severe disease and effects However infants and toddlers are at risk of developing critical course. The disease has a range of clinical presentations in children, for which the potential need for further investigation of myocardial injury and cardiovascular issues should be kept in mind to avoid misdiagnosing severe clinical entities. Overlapping with Kawasaki disease is a concern, particularly the incomplete and atypical form. We aim to summarize the initial considerations and potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 for children and patients with congenital heart disease.

The present communication discusses some common pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs that may be linked to a potential underlying mechanism of action for these antiviral effects. The physicochemical properties of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are consistent with particularly high affinity for the intracellular lysosomal space, which has been implicated as a target site for antiviral activity. The properties of both drugs predict dramatic accumulation in lysosomes, with calculated lysosomal drug concentrations that exceed cytosolic and extracellular concentrations by more than 50 000-fold. These predictions are consistent with previously reported experimentally measured cellular and extracellular concentrations of azithromycin. This is also reflected in the very large volumes of distribution of these drugs, which are among the highest of all drugs currently in use. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin produces very high local concentrations in lysosomes. The clinical significance of this observation is unclear; however, the magnitude of this mechanism of drug accumulation via ion-trapping in lysosomes could be an important factor for the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug combination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antivirus agent; azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; human; lysosome; pandemic; virus load; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Lysosomes; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Load",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Hydroxychloroquine",,,,,,"Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Hoang, V.T., Meddeb, L., Mailhe, M., Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents; Gautret, P., Lagier, J.C., Parola, P., Hoang, V.T., Meddeb, L., Sevestre, J., Clinical and microbiological effect of a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 80 COVID-19 patients with at least a six-day follow up: A pilot observational study (2020) Travel Med Infect Dis; Molina, J.M., Delaugerre, C., Le Goff, J., Mela-Lima, B., Ponscarme, D., Goldwirt, L., No evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (2020) Med Mal Infect, , pii: S0399-077X(20)30085-8; Juurlink, D.N., Safety considerations with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection (2020) CMAJ, , pii: cmaj.200528; Lemaire, S., Tulkens, P.M., Van Bambeke, F., Cellular pharmacokinetics of the novel biaryloxazolidinone radezolid in phagocytic cells: studies with macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (2010) Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 54 (6), pp. 2540-2548; Schroeder, R.L., Gerber, J.P., Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine binding to melanin: Some possible consequences for pathologies (2014) Toxicol Rep, 1, pp. 963-968; Kazmi, F., Hensley, T., Pope, C., Funk, R.S., Loewen, G.J., Buckley, D.B., Lysosomal sequestration (trapping) of lipophilic amine (cationic amphiphilic) drugs in immortalized human hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells) (2013) Drug Metab Dispos, 41 (4), pp. 897-905; MacIntyre, A.C., Cutler, D.J., The potential role of lysosomes in tissue distribution of weak bases (1988) Biopharm Drug Dispos, 9 (6), pp. 513-526; Tett, S.E., Cutler, D.J., Day, R.O., Brown, K.F., A dose-ranging study of the pharmacokinetics of hydroxy-chloroquine following intravenous administration to healthy volunteers (1988) Br J Clin Pharmacol, 26 (3), pp. 303-313; Carlier, M.B., Garcia-Luque, I., Montenez, J.P., Tulkens, P.M., Piret, J., Accumulation, release and subcellular localization of azithromycin in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells in culture (1994) Int J Tissue React, 16 (5-6), pp. 211-220; Tyteca, D., Van Der Smissen, P., Mettlen, M., Van Bambeke, F., Tulkens, P.M., Mingeot-Leclercq, M.P., Azithromycin, a lysosomotropic antibiotic, has distinct effects on fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis, but does not impair phagocytosis in J774 macrophages (2002) Exp Cell Res, 281 (1), pp. 86-100; Tyteca, D., Van Der Smissen, P., Van Bambeke, F., Leys, K., Tulkens, P.M., Courtoy, P.J., Azithromycin, a lysosomotropic antibiotic, impairs fluid-phase pinocytosis in cultured fibroblasts (2001) Eur J Cell Biol, 80 (7), pp. 466-478; Van Bambeke, F., Montenez, J.P., Piret, J., Tulkens, P.M., Courtoy, P.J., Mingeot-Leclerq, M.P., Interaction of the macrolide azithromycin with phospholipids.

COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences. © 2020 The Authors","ACE2; Cardiovascular disease; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","alpha interferon; anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; azithromycin; camostat mesilate; chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; neutralizing antibody; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; ribavirin; siltuximab; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Article; cardiovascular disease; cell surface; cellular distribution; coronavirus disease 2019; disease activity; drug safety; drug targeting; enzyme mechanism; heart arrhythmia; hemophilia; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; infection risk; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; protein expression; protein interaction; QT prolongation; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tachycardia; thrombosis; torsade des pointes",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; angiotensin II, 11128-99-7, 68521-88-0; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat mesilate, 59721-29-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; losartan, 114798-26-4; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; umifenovir, 131707-25-0",,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: KFO311, TRR267

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. METHODS: Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.6±24.9 versus 439.9±24.7 ms, P=0.834). The maximum corrected QT interval during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group versus the monotherapy group (470.4±45.0 ms versus 453.3±37.0 ms, P=0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to corrected QT interval prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest reported cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin, no instances of Torsade de pointes, or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.","azithromycin; chloroquine; COVID-19; hydroxychloroquine; pandemic; QT prolongation",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,19413084,,,"32347743","English","Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616456

With benefit evaluations underway, safety concerns due to potential additive effects on QTc prolongation should be addressed. Objective: We compared risk of cardiac adverse events between combinations of chloroquine and azithromycin and chloroquine and amoxicillin. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases, 2005–2018. We included autoimmune disease patients aged ≥18 years initiating azithromycin or amoxicillin for ≥5 days during chloroquine treatment. Patients had continuous insurance coverage ≥6 months before combination use until 5 days thereafter or inpatient death. Two outcomes were sudden cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmias (SCA/VA) and cardiac symptoms. We followed patients for up to 5 days to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Covariates were adjusted using stabilized inverse probability treatment weighting. Results: We identified two SVC/VA events among >145,000 combination users. The adjusted incidence of cardiac symptoms among azithromycin and amoxicillin users was 276 vs 254 per 10,000 person-years with an adjusted HR of 1.10 (95%CI, 0.62–1.95). Conclusion: Combination use of chloroquine and azithromycin at routine doses did not show pronounced increases in arrhythmias in this real-world population, though small sample size and outcome rates limit conclusions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cardiac events; Chloroquine; COVID19; Hydroxychloroquine; QTc prolongation",,,,,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA.

Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. Methods We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. Results Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up. Conclusions Kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 have presentations that are similar to that of the general population. Our current treatment protocol appears to be associated with favorable outcomes, but longer follow-up of a larger cohort of patients is needed.

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57–79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the “cytokine storm syndrome”, a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34–35 °C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40°–41 °C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8–5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death. © 2020","Aerosol vaporization and nebulization; Alcoholic gargle; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; IL-1/IL-6; Monoclonal antibody; Povidone-iodine gargle and eye drop; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2; Viral pneumonia","azithromycin; chloroquine; colchicine; heparin; metformin; nicotinamide riboside; rapamycin; remdesivir; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug structure; hospitalization; human; in vitro study; inhalational drug administration; nebulization; positive end expiratory pressure; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaporization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; nicotinamide riboside, 1341-23-7; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Ylikoski, J.A., Savolainen, S.A., Jousimies-Somer, H., Bacterial flora in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of healthy young men (1989) ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec, 51 (1), pp. 50-55; (2000), www.icsi.org, Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.

Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other. Precise analysis and separation of individual tasks can enable the creation of a real crisis management plan. © 2020 MEDPRESS.","COVID-19; help organization; pathogenesis; treatment","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; health care personnel management; human; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Crew Resource Management, Healthcare; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral",,"dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,14269686,,,"32352944","Polish","Pol.

Dębinki 7, Gdańsk, 80-211, Poland","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are: fever (81.8%–100%), cough (46.3%–86.2%), myalgia and fatigue (11%–50%), expectoration (4.4%–72%), and dyspnea (18.6%–59%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19 include decreased lymphocyte count (35%–82.1%), thrombocytopenia (17%–36.2%), elevated serum C-reactive protein (60.7%–93%), lactate dehydrogenase (41%–76%), and D-dimer concentrations (36%–46.4%). Among comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, cardiovascular disease is most commonly found. In addition, patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases have worse prognosis and more often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), compared with patients without such comorbidities. It is estimated that about 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is more prevalent among patients with COVID-19 who require ICU care. In a group of critically ill patients, 27.5% had an elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentration, and increased cardiac troponin level was found in 10% of patients. One of the life-threatening cardiac manifestations is coronavirus fulminant myocarditis, which may also occur without accompanying symptoms of pulmonary involvement. Early recognition and treatment is crucial in these cases. So far, data on the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 are limited. Coronavirus disease 2019 impacts patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and affects daily practice of cardiologists. Thus, it is important to know typical COVID-19 symptoms, possible clinical manifestations, complications, and recommended treatment.

The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the major research themes in COVID-19 literature, (2) determine the origin, symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID, (3) recommend the intervention and mitigation strategies adopted by the Governments globally against the spread of COVID-19 and the traumatization among the public? and (4) study the possible drugs/treatment plans against COVID-19. A systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of 38 research articles on COVID-19 are conducted. An integrated Research focus parallel-ship network and keyword co-occurrence analysis are carried out to visualize the three research concepts in COVID-19 literature. Some of our observations include: (1) as SARS-CoV-2’s RNA matches ~ 96% to SARS-CoV, it is assumed to be transmitted from the bats. (2) The common symptoms are high fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, diarrhoea etc. (3) A lockdown across 180 affected counties for more than a month with social-distancing and the precautions taken in SARS and MERS are recommended by the Governments. (4) Researchers’ claim that nutrition and immunity enhancers and treatment plans such as arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells and drugs including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and favipiravir are effective against COVID-19. This complied report serves as guide to help the administrators, researchers and the medical officers to adopt recommended intervention strategies and the optimal treatment/drug against COVID-19. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.","Drugs; Interventions; Network analysis; Origin; SARS-CoV-2; Symptoms",,,,,,,,,"Ammad, M., Din, U., Krishna L (2020) Boppana T., p. 6553. , (in press); Banerjee, D., The COVID-19 outbreak: crucial role the psychiatrists can play (2020) Asian J Psychiatr, 50, p. 102014; Bastian, M., Heymann, S., Jacomy, M., Gephi: An open source software for exploring and manipulating networks (2009) Third International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, pp. 361-362. , https://doi.org/10.1136/qshc.2004.010033; Bernard Stoecklin, S., Rolland, P., Silue, Y., First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France: surveillance, investigations and control measures, January 2020 (2020) Euro Surveill, 25 (6), p. 2000094; Callon, M., Courtial, J.P., Turner, W.A., Bauin, S., From translations to problematic networks: an introduction to co-word analysis (1983) Soc Sci Inf., 22 (2), pp. 191-235; Catton, H., Global challenges in health and health care for nurses and midwives everywhere (2020) Int Nurs Rev, 67 (1), pp. 4-6; Chen, J., Hu, C., Chen, L., Clinical study of mesenchymal stem cell treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by epidemic influenza A (H7N9) infection: a hint for COVID-19 treatment (2020) Engineering; Chen, D., Xu, W., Lei, Z., Recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19: a case report (2020) Int J Infect Dis, 93, pp. 297-299. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXlsl2gtLo%3D; Combe, D., Largeron, C., De, L.U., A comparative study of social network analysis tools (2010) Int Work Web Intell Virtual Enterp, 2012 (2), pp. 1-12; Daw, M.A., Medicine, T., Disease, I., Preliminary epidemiological analysis of suspected cases of corona virus Infection in Libya (2020) Travel Med Infect Dis; Deng, L., Li, C., Zeng, Q., Liu, X., Li, X., Zhang, H., Hong, Z., Xia, J., Arbidol combined with LPV/r versus LPV/r alone against Corona Virus Disease 2019: A retrospective cohort study (2020) J Infect, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.002; de Groot, R.J., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): announcement of the coronavirus study group (2013) J Virol, 87 (14), pp. 7790-7792; Dong, L., Hu, S., Gao, J., Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Drug Discov Ther, 14 (1), pp. 58-60; Gao, P., Zhang, H., Wu, Z., Wang, J., Visualising the expansion and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 by cartograms (2020) Environ Plan A Econ Sp; Haider, N., Yavlinsky, A., Simons, D., Passengers’ destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America (2020) Epidemiol Infect, 148 (February); Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., Schroeder, S., SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor (2020) Cell; Hou, H., Kretschmer, H., Liu, Z., The structure of scientific collaboration networks in scientometrics (2008) Scientometrics, 75 (2), pp. 189-202; Hu, Z., Song, C., Xu, C., Clinical characteristics of 24 asymptomatic infections with COVID-19 screened among close contacts in Nanjing, China (2020) Sci China Life Sci; Info, A., (2020) Infection, Genetics and Evolution Letter to Editor, 82 (March), pp. 1-3; Jalava, K., First respiratory transmitted food borne outbreak?

We conducted this study to help pediatricians understand the conditions of COVID-19 in children. Methods: We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan Children's Hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes. Results: As of February 29, 75 children had been discharged, of which only one was has severe pneumonia and one was critical cases. Children younger than 2 years were more susceptible to COVID-19. All patients have received interferon-α nebulization, and eight cases including the severe and critical cases were co-administrated ribavirin. Five patients with mild pneumonia were given arbidol. Twenty-three patients were given traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The average length of stay (LOS) and the time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 10.57 and 6.39 days, respectively. None of the factors was associated with LOS or time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases were milder than adults. The efficacy of the antiviral therapy in children with COVID-19 remains to be evaluated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Characteristics; Coronavirus disease 2019; Outcomes; Pediatric; Treatment","antiinfective agent; arbidol; azithromycin; oseltamivir; recombinant alpha interferon; recombinant interferon alpha 1b; ribavirin; unclassified drug; adolescent; antimicrobial therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; child; Chinese medicine; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; female; human; infant; influenza; length of stay; major clinical study; male; Mycoplasma pneumonia; nebulization; pneumonia; priority journal; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral clearance",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; ribavirin, 36791-04-5",,"beijing sanyuan, China; shenzhen kexing, China",,,,"Cai, J., Xu, J., Lin, D., A Case Series of children with 2019 novel coronavirus infection: clinical and epidemiological features (2020) Clin.

Here we explore the idea that an exacerbated inflammatory response, in particular that mediated by IL-6, may drive the deleterious consequences of the infection. Data shows that other RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, can display enhanced replication efficiency in senescent cells, suggesting that the accumulation of senescent cells with aging and age-related diseases may play a role in this phenomenon. However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19. The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.","cellular senescence; extracellular vesicles; inflammation; mitochondria; SASP inhibitors; senolytics; senoptotics; viral infection","antiinfective agent; azithromycin; interleukin 6; pyrazole derivative; ruxolitinib; aging; cell aging; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; immunology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Aging; Anti-Infective Agents; Azithromycin; Cellular Senescence; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pyrazoles",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; Anti-Infective Agents; Azithromycin; INCB018424; Interleukin-6; Pyrazoles",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,20734409,,,"32276453","English","Cells",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083179365

CloroCovid-19 Team","Importance: There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions: Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results: Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance: The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3.

It has placed societal and financial burden on the globe. Its rapid progressions from mild URI symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a matter of days is the underlying reason as to why the world is struggling to keep up with ventilator production. In this case report, we went about proning a corona virus positive patient for 6–8hrs as a potential early intervention to prevent progression to ARDS. Our patient was initially in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and placed on nasal cannula. He was started on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with no improvement of symptoms. However within the span of few hours of proning he experienced significant symptomatic relief with improvement of oxygenation. His oxygen saturation improved drastically and eventually was taken off of nasal cannula and discharged within span of one day of proning. © 2020",,"azithromycin; hydroxychloroquine; oxygen; piperacillin plus tazobactam; vancomycin; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; blood oxygenation; case report; clinical article; community acquired pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; differential diagnosis; early intervention; hospital discharge; human; hypoxemia; male; oxygen saturation; priority journal; prone position; respiratory failure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9",,,,,,"Tawhai, M.H., Nash, M.P., Lin, C.L., Hoffman, E.A., Supine and prone differences in regional lung density and pleural pressure gradients in the human lung with constant shape (1985) J.

Methods: This retrospective and the single-center study were done at the Public Health Clinic Center of Changsha, Hunan, China. We identified all hospitalized children diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 8, 2019 and February 19, 2020, in Changsha. Epidemiological and clinical data of these children were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed until February 26th, 2020. Results: By February 19, 2020, nine pediatric patients were identified as having 2019-nCoV infection in Changsha. Six children had a family exposure and could provide the exact dates of close contact with someone who was confirmed to have 2019-nCoV infection, among whom the median incubation period was 7.5 days. The initial symptoms of the nine children were mild, including fever (3/9), diarrhea (2/9), cough (1/9), and sore throat (1/9), two had no symptoms. Two of the enrolled patients showed small ground-glass opacity of chest computed tomography scan. As of February 26, six patients had a negative RT-PCR for 2019-nCoV and were discharged. The median time from exposure to a negative RT-PCR was 14 days. Conclusions: The clinical symptoms of the new coronavirus infection in children were not typical and showed a less aggressive clinical course than teenage and adult patients. Children who have a familial clustering or have a family member with a definite diagnosis should be reported to ensure a timely diagnosis. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","children; clinical characteristics; coronavirus disease 2019","azithromycin; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; meprednisone; Article; child; China; clinical article; clinical feature; clinical study; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; epidemiological data; female; fever; human; incubation time; male; preschool child; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; school child; sore throat; age; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infant; isolation and purification; pandemic; pathology; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Age Factors; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; meprednisone, 1247-42-3",,,"2015JJ4087

On presentation, her physical examination was benign, except for sinus tachycardia, and she was oxygenating adequately on room air. Laboratory studies were unremarkable, except a PCR test positive for SARS-COV2, and a CT scan of her chest showed bilateral multi-focal ground-glass opacities. A fetal non-stress test was reassuring. She was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine. During her hospital stay, she developed progressively worsening respiratory failure, initially requiring non-invasive ventilation, and subsequently progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. She then suffered from sudden hypoxemia and hemodynamic collapse, on maximal ventilatory support, prompting an emergency cesarean section at bedside. This led to rapid stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and of her overall respiratory status. Both the twins were born prematurely, and one of them tested positive for SARS-COV2. © 2020","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Mechanical ventilation; Novel coronavirus disease; Twin pregnancy; Vertical transmission","azithromycin; betamethasone; ceftriaxone; hydroxychloroquine; noradrenalin; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial ventilation; breathing rate; case report; cesarean section; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; drug dose titration; dyspnea; endotracheal intubation; female; fever; heart rate; human; hypotension; intensive care unit; lung auscultation; lung hemorrhage; male; mean arterial pressure; newborn; oxygen saturation; oxygen supply; pneumonia; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tachycardia; thorax pain; thorax radiography; twin pregnancy",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; betamethasone, 378-44-9; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; noradrenalin, 1407-84-7, 51-41-2",,,,,,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Situation Report – 112 (5/11/2020) (2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200511-covid-19-sitrep-112.pdf?sfvrsn=813f2669_2; Zhu, N., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh human corona virus after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The disease presentation can range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and death. As of now, the experience in Indian set-up is limited. There is even less to draw from in terms of experience in pregnant women and neonates. Pregnancy is a physiological state involving changes that predispose to respiratory complications of viral infection. Limited knowledge available on corona virus infections during pregnancy is attributable to the findings in SARS and MERS epidemics. Clinical manifestations in pregnancy were found to be similar to those of non-pregnant adults with nCOVID-19 that have been reported in the literature without increased susceptibility. Recent evidences have shown the absence of vertical transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from mother to infant. In India, cost-effective and readily available drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are used for nCOVID-19 infection as per guidelines given by the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). All the patients with nCOVID-19 in labour universally delivered by caesarean section. Initiation of breastfeeding is controversial. The principle guidelines for isolation, quarantine, case definition, contact tracing, notification and testing are same as that of the general public. © 2020, Radiance Research Academy.

A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day 10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia, concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels. VV-ECMO was initiated after sudden exacerbation of respiratory dysfunction on ICU day 7 to maintain oxygenation. The sustained excessive inflammatory cytokines in the present case might have led to the exacerbation of the disease, requiring vigorous organ support therapies to allow for survival and recovery from the rapid progression of multiple organ dysfunctions and severe respiratory failure. © 2020, The Japanese Society for Artificial Organs.","COVID-19; Respiratory failure; SARS-CoV-2; VV-ECMO",,,,,,,,,"Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , (Epub ahead of print; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/, March 17, 2020., Accessed 31 Mar 2020; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan China (2020) Lancet, 15, pp. 497-506; Puja, M., Daniel, F., Michael, B., Emilie, S., Rachel, S.T., Jessica, J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; Qiurong, R., Kun, Y., Wenxia, W., Lingyu, J., Jianxin, S., Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan China (2020) Intensive Care Med, 3, pp. 1-3; Davies, A., Jones, D., Bailey, M., Beca, J., Bellomo, R., Blackwell, N., Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) acute respiratory distress syndrome (2009) JAMA, 302, pp. 1888-1895. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD1MXhtlynu7zM; Barbaro, R.P., Odetola, F.O., Kidwell, K.M., Paden, M.L., Bartlett, R.H., Davis, M.M., Association of hospital-level volume of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cases and mortality.

The particular severity of the disease and higher mortality rates in patients with associated morbidities, including hypertension, obesity and diabetes, increases the concern over the consequences of this pandemic. In this review, the features of SARS-CoV-2 will be addressed, as well as the reasons why it poses a particular challenge to diabetic patients. We will also highlight the recent treatment strategies being explored to control this pandemic. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the correct management of diabetes in those patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is of utmost importance for the viral disease progression, therefore, the importance of blood glucose control will also be addressed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","ACE inhibitors; ACE-2; COVID-19; Diabetes; Glycemic control; SARS-CoV-2","amiodarone; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; aromatase inhibitor; ascorbic acid; azithromycin; beta interferon; beta1 interferon; camostat mesilate; chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; glucagon like peptide receptor agonist; glucose; hydroxychloroquine; insulin; lopinavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; messenger RNA; metformin; monoclonal antibody; oseltamivir; pioglitazone; remdesivir; ritonavir; RNA directed RNA polymerase inhibitor; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; unindexed drug; virus spike protein; zinc oxide nanoparticle; acidosis; acute lung injury; adjuvant therapy; adult respiratory distress syndrome; China; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disease severity; drug withdrawal; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; glycemic control; human; hypertension; infection control; medical decision making; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; mortality rate; nausea; nonhuman; obesity; pandemic; prognosis; protein expression; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; unspecified side effect; virus entry; virus pneumonia; vomiting",,"amiodarone, 1951-25-3, 19774-82-4, 62067-87-2; ascorbic acid, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat mesilate, 59721-29-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; insulin, 9004-10-8; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; losartan, 114798-26-4; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; pioglitazone, 105355-27-9, 111025-46-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5",,,"SFRH/BD/139402/2018, UID/BIM/04293/2019, PD/BD/145149/2019, SFRH/BD/117598/2016

The number of deaths reached 12 784, with estimated case-fatality rates ranging from 0.5% to 5.7%. Children population seems to be the least affected by the disease, while the highest rate of death is among the elderly and people with comorbidities. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic or only exhibit mild symptoms. After the incubation period, the most common symptoms are fever, cough and fatigue. Asymptomatic carrier state is of paramount importance because of carriers' ability to spread the infection and to shed the virus into the air and surroundings. Although much is still unknown about SARS-CoV-2, the scientific research is moving at an unprecedented pace towards understanding the nature, effective control, prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Various reports have suggested an in vivo evolution of the virus, which may explain the rapid spread and changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, but further evidence is needed. Unfortunately, no effective treatment or therapeutic drug is available for the disease; only supportive treatment and classical intervention measures are available for confronting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s)","2109-nCoV; Asymptomatic; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Europe; Pneumonia; Quarantine; Transmission","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; D dimer; hydroxychloroquine; procalcitonin; virus spike protein; amino acid sequence; artificial ventilation; Betacoronavirus; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; conserved sequence; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease control; dyspnea; feces analysis; fever; genetic variability; headache; hemoptysis; human; hypertransaminasemia; immunity; incubation time; lung lavage; lymphocytopenia; mortality rate; nonhuman; open reading frame; oxygen saturation; pandemic; pneumonia; priority journal; prothrombin time; quarantine; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; viral clearance; virus genome; virus morphology; virus transmission; whole genome sequencing",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,,,,"World Health Organization, Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation report—1 (2020), World Health Organization Geneva; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med; Wu, A., Peng, Y., Huang, B., Ding, X., Wang, X., Niu, P., Genome composition and divergence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in China (2020) Cell Host Microbe, 27, pp. 325-328; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 565-574; Ji, W., Wang, W., Zhao, X., Zai, J., Li, X., Cross-species transmission of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV (2020) J Med Virol, 92, pp. 433-440; Cyranoski, D., Mystery deepens over animal source of coronavirus (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 18-19; World Health Organization, Situation reports (2020), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports, Available at:; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Guan, W., Ni, Z., Hu, Y., Liang, W., Ou, C., He, J., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) JAMA; Yang, S., Cao, P., Du, P., Wu, Z., Zhuang, Z., Yang, L., Early estimation of the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in mainland China: a data-driven analysis (2020) Ann Transl Med, 8, p. 128; Chan, J.F.W., Kok, K.H., Zhu, Z., Chu, H., To, K.K.W., Yuan, S., Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9, pp. 221-236; Paraskevis, D., Kostaki, E.G., Magiorkinis, G., Panayiotakopoulos, G., Sourvinos, G., Tsiodras, S., Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event (2020) Infect Genet Evol, 79, p. 104212; Wen, F., Yu, H., Guo, J., Li, Y., Luo, K., Huang, S., Identification of the hyper-variable genomic hotspot for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2020) J Infect; Alexander, D.J., Brown, I.H., History of highly pathogenic avian influenza (2009) Rev Sci Tech, 28, pp. 19-38; Chan-Yeung, M., Seto, W.H., Sung, J.J.Y., Severe acute respiratory syndrome: patients were epidemiologically linked (2003) BMJ, 326, p. 1393; Guo, Y.R., Cao, Q.D., Hong, Z.S., Tan, Y.Y., Chen, S.D., Jin, H.J., The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak—an update on the status (2020) Mil Med Res, 7, p. 11; Giovanetti, M., Benvenuto, D., Angeletti, S., Ciccozzi, M., The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: where they come from?

However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the target plasma and lung concentrations of these drugs following approved dosing in humans. Accordingly, EC90 values recalculated from in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) at an approved dose in humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1. A more in-depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval. An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir-boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir-boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (ritonavir-boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC50 by 7.8- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.

Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections; procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs; it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results. Protocols such as Step-by-Step, Laboratory Score, or the Rochester algorithms may be helpful in identifying low-risk patients. Rapid influenza testing and tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be of value when those diseases are circulating. When empiric treatment is appropriate, suggested antibiotics include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for infants one to three months of age and ampicillin with gentamicin or with cefotaxime for neonates. For children three months to three years of age, azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended if pneumonia is suspected; for urinary infections, suggested antibiotics are cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Choice of antibiotics should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15320650,,,"32538597","English","Am Fam Physician",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086532204
