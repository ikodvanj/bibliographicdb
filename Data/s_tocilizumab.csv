To date, no medication supported by randomized clinical trials has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of writing of this paper, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible - according to modest estimations - for around 4 million of infections and 300 000 deaths. Unveiling details of patomechanism, in fatal cases the role of immune dysregulation, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been discovered. Based on the current knowledge, interleukin-6 (IL6) plays a pivotal role in COVID-19 associated CRS. Case reports and result of small case series suggest efficacy of an IL6 inhibitor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) in treating CRS. Authors describe a case and review recent knowledge on the treatment of COVID-19. To our knowledge, the first case of severe COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome - treated succesfully with IL6 monoclocal antibody at a Hungarian department of infectology - is presented here.

About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality. © 2020 The Author(s).","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); COVID-19; IL-6; Inflammatory storm; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab","interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; lopinavir; methylprednisolone; oxygen; tocilizumab; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; allergy; autopsy; body temperature; chemoluminescence; continuous infusion; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug contraindication; drug efficacy; drug targeting; human; immune response; intensive care unit; lung alveolus; lung biopsy; lung gas exchange; medical research; mixed infection; monocyte; mortality; public health problem; receptor blocking; recommended drug dose; respiratory function; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T lymphocyte; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; virus identification; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; severity of illness index; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index",,"lopinavir, 192725-17-0; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; oxygen, 7782-44-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; IL6 protein, human; Interleukin-6; tocilizumab",,,,,,"Channappanavar, R., Perlman, S., Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: Causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology (2017) Semin Immunopathol, 39, pp. 529-539. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2sXntVGquro%3D; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473; https://lab.gedidigital.it/gedi-visual/2020/coronavirus-i-contagi-in-italia/; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Gu, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Kqu7c%3D; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Zhu, F., Liu, X., Zhang, J., Wang, B., Xiong, Y., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA, , 10.1001/jama.2020.1585; Tian, S., Hu, W., Niu, L., Liu, H., Xu, H., Xiao, S.Y., Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer (2020) J Thorac Oncol, , 10.1016/j.jtho.2020.02.010 32114094 7128866; Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Zhang, J., Huang, L., Zhang, C., Liu, S., Zhu, L., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Respir Med, 8 (4), pp. 420-422. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXjsValtbk%3D; Luo, W., Yu, H., Gou, J., Li, X., Sun, Y., Li, J., Liu, L., (2020) Clinical Pathology of Critical Patient with Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (COVID-19).

Several clinical studies have shown very good effects of TCZ in patients with COVID-19, with a few minor side effects reported. Only eight serious liver injuries caused by TCZ were reported before being used in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Considering the significantly increased use of TCZ for the treatment of COVID-19, we would like to warn of its rare but possible serious hepatotoxicity, especially when used together with other hepatotoxic drugs. Methods: We describe a patient with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who developed drug-induced liver injury associated with the use of TCZ. Results: One day after TCZ administration, serum transaminase levels increased 40-fold. Nevertheless, TCZ had a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters in cytokine storm, with transaminases values normalizing in 10 days. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of DILI caused by TCZ in a COVID-19 patient. Intensive liver function monitoring is imperative in COVID-19 patients, because of frequent polypharmacy with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab. Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This study aims to evaluate if tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces patients’ mortality. Methods: 85 consecutive patients admitted to the Montichiari Hospital (Italy) with COVID-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure, not needing mechanical ventilation, were included if satisfying at least one among: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 93% or PaO2/FiO2<=300 mmHg. Patients admitted before March 13th (n=23) were prescribed the standard therapy (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir) and were considered controls. On March 13th tocilizumab was available and patients admitted thereafter (n=62) received tocilizumab once within 4 days from admission, plus the standard care. Results: Patients receiving tocilizumab showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients (hazard ratio for death, 0.035; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. Two out of 62 patients of the tocilizumab group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died. 92% and 42.1% of the discharged patients in the tocilizumab and control group respectively, recovered. The respiratory function resulted improved in 64.8% of the observations in tocilizumab patients who were still hospitalized, whereas 100% of controls worsened and needed mechanical ventilation. No infections were reported. Conclusions: Tocilizumab results to have a positive impact if used early during Covid-19 pneumonia with severe respiratory syndrome in terms of increased survival and favorable clinical course. © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine","COVID-19; Pneumonia; Respiratory failure; Retrospective study; SARS-cov-2; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Guan, W.J., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Xu, Z., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Respir Med; Zhou, F., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Liu, T., The potential role of IL-6 in monitoring severe case of coronavirus disease2019. medRxiv; Channappanavar, R., Perlman, S., Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology (2017) Semin Immunopathol, 39 (5), pp. 529-539; Omrani, A.S., Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a for severe middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a retrospective cohort study (2014) Lancet Infect Dis, 14 (11), pp. 1090-1095; Ortiz-Martinez, Y., Tocilizumab: a new opportunity in the possible therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19 (2020) Travel Med Infect Dis; Fu, B., Xu, X., Wei, H., Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?

The severity and mortality of the disease is associated with a high level of release of cytokine in the patients which is known as CRS (cytokine release syndrome) or cytokine storm syndrome. IL-6 is a type of pro-inflammatory cytokine which release in the severe COVID-19 patients. This cytokine initiates CRS the JAK-STAT or MAPK/NF-κB-IL-6 pathway. Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is designed to bind both mIL-6R (membrane bound receptor for IL-6) and sIL-6R (soluble receptor for IL-6) and inhibit the JAK-STAT or MAPK/NF-κB-IL-6 signaling pathway. It finally stops the cytokine storm syndrome. However, we need to understand that how tocilizumab is bound with mIL-6R or sIL-6R. Similarly, we also need to understand more about the real molecular mechanism of activity of tocilizumab. © 2020 IMSS","COVID-19; Cytokine storm syndrome; Therapeutic option; Tocilizumab",,,,,,"NRF2020R1C1C1008694, NRF2017R1A2B4012944

Inhibition of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab has been employed successfully in some of these patients but the data is mostly consistent of case reports and series. Methods: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 22nd April 2020 and again on 27th April 2020 using the following search terms alone or in combination: “COVID-19,” “coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID,” “anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibodies,” “anti-IL-6,” “tocilizumab,” “sarilumab,” “siltuximab.” We included studies that reported individual patient data. We extracted and analyzed individual level data on baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included in-hospital complications, recovery rates, effect of patient characteristics on the primary outcome and changes in levels of inflammatory markers. Results: Three hundred fifty-two records were identified through a systematic search, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. A single study currently under review was also added. Eleven observational studies encompassing 29 patients were included in the present review. There were more males (24 [82.8%]), and hypertension was the most common comorbidity (16 [48.3%]). Over an average of 5.4 hospital days, the primary endpoint occurred in 6 (20.7%) patients. Among surviving patients, about 10% had worsened disease and 17% recovered. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (8 [27.6%]). The IL-6 level was significantly higher after the initiation of tocilizumab with median (interquartile range) of 376.6 (148-900.6) pg/mL compared to the baseline of 71.1 (31.9-122.8) pg/mL (P =.002). Mean (standard deviation) levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly decreased following treatment 24.6 (26.9) mg/L compared to baseline 140.4 (77) mg/L (P <.0001). Baseline demographics were not significantly different among survivors and nonsurvivors by Fisher's exact test. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab, IL-6 levels are significantly elevated, which are supportive of cytokine storm. Following initiation of tocilizumab, there is elevation in the IL-6 levels and CRP levels dramatically decrease, suggesting an improvement in this hyperinflammatory state. Ongoing randomized control trials will allow for further evaluation of this promising therapy. Importance: Recent data indicate that severe COVID-19 causes a cytokine release storm and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and IL-6 plays an important role. It is suggestive that anti-IL-6 results in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. However, to our knowledge, there is no individual patient data systematic review performed to summarize baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients who received tocilizumab. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody;

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large and there is still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. Two of them were moderately ill, six were seriously ill and seven were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone in eight patients. Five patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the four critically ill patients who received an only single dose of TCZ, three of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest one patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these four patients who failed treatment. TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, the repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","COVID-19; cytokine storms; interleukin-6; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab","C reactive protein; interleukin 6; methylprednisolone; tocilizumab; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; demography; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug response; female; human; male; middle aged; observational study; outcome assessment; protein blood level; retrospective study; single drug dose",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Respir Med., 8, pp. 420-422; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Kaur, S., Bansal, Y., Kumar, R., Bansal, G., A panoramic review of IL-6: structure, pathophysiological roles and inhibitors (2020) Bioorg Med Chem, 28 (5); Xu, Y.H., Dong, J.H., An, W.M., Clinical and computed tomographic imaging features of novel coronavirus pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (2020) J Infect, 80, pp. 394-400; Kotch, C., Barrett, D., Teachey, D.T., Tocilizumab for the treatment of chimeric antigen receptor T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (2019) Expert Rev Clin Immunol, 15 (8), pp. 813-822; Chiaretti, A., Pulitanò, S., Barone, G., IL-1 beta and IL-6 upregulation in children with H1N1 influenza virus infection (2013) Mediators Inflamm, 2013; Nishimoto, N., Terao, K., Mima, T., Nakahara, H., Takagi, N., Kakehi, T., Mechanisms and pathologic significances in increase in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble IL-6 receptor after administration of an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman disease (2008) Blood, 112 (10), pp. 3959-3964","Liu, D.; Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: l_d2069@163.com",,,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",,,,,01466615,,JMVID,"32253759","English","J.

Design: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled in SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE). A retrospective analysis of patients treated with TCZ matched using propensity score to patients treated with Standard Of Care (SOC) was conducted. Setting: The study was conducted at IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy, from March 14, 2020 to March 27, 2020. Participants: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized in our institution at the time of TCZ availability. Interventions: TCZ was administered to 21 patients. The first administration was 8 mg/kg (up to a maximum 800 mg per dose) of Tocilizumab intravenously, repeated after 12 h if no side effects were reported after the first dose. Main Outcomes and Measures: ICU admission and 7-day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory data. Results: There were 112 patients evaluated (82 were male and 30 were female, with a median age of 63.55 years). Using propensity scores, the 21 patients who received TCZ were matched to 21 patients who received SOC (a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and prophylactic dose of low weight heparin). No adverse event was detected following TCZ administration. This study found that treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect ICU admission (OR 0.11; 95% CI between 0.00 and 3.38; p = 0.22) or 7-day mortality rate (OR 0.78; 95% CI between 0.06 and 9.34; p = 0.84) when compared with SOC. Analysis of laboratory measures showed significant interactions between time and treatment regarding C-Reactive Protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets and international normalized ratio (INR) levels. Variation in lymphocytes count was observed over time, irrespective of treatment. Conclusions: TCZ administration did not reduce ICU admission or mortality rate in a cohort of 21 patients. Additional data are needed to understand the effect(s) of TCZ in treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on severe COVID-19 patients with hyper-inflammatory features admitted outside intensive care units (ICUs). Patients treated with intravenous TCZ in addition to standard of care were compared to patients treated with standard of care alone. Safety and efficacy were assessed over a 28-day follow-up. Results: 65 patients were included. Among them, 32 were treated with TCZ. At baseline, all patients were on high-flow supplemental oxygen and most (78% of TCZ patients and 61% of standard treatment patients) were on non-invasive ventilation. During the 28-day follow-up, 69% of TCZ patients experienced a clinical improvement compared to 61% of standard treatment patients (p = 0.61). Mortality was 15% in the tocilizumab group and 33% in standard treatment group (p = 0.15). In TCZ group, at multivariate analysis, older age was a predictor of death, whereas higher baseline PaO2:FiO2 was a predictor of clinical improvement at day 28. The rate of infection and pulmonary thrombosis was similar between the two groups. Conclusions: At day 28, clinical improvement and mortality were not statistically different between tocilizumab and standard treatment patients in our cohort. Bacterial or fungal infections were recorded in 13% of tocilizumab patients and in 12% of standard treatment patients. Confirmation of efficacy and safety will require ongoing controlled trials. © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Efficacy; Interleukin-6; Italy; Safety; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,"We wish to thank all the patients who participated in this study and their families.

This inflammation is supposed to be the main driver in the pathogenesis of lung failure (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in COVID-19. Objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose treatment with Tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19. We hypothesize that Tocilizumab slows down the progression of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia and inflammation. We expect an improvement in pulmonary function compared to placebo-treated patients. Desirable outcomes would be that tocilizumab reduces the number of days that patients are dependent on mechanical ventilation and reduces the invasiveness of breathing assistance. Furthermore, this treatment might result in fewer admissions to intensive care units. Next to these efficacy parameters, safety of a therapy with Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients has to be monitored closely, since immunosuppression could lead to an increased rate of bacterial infections, which could negatively influence the patient's outcome. TRIAL DESIGN: Multicentre, prospective, 2-arm randomised (ratio 1:1), double blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel group design. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria 1.Proof of SARS-CoV2 (Symptoms and positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR))2.Severe respiratory failure: a.Ambient air SpO2 ≤ 92% orb.Need of ≥ 6l O2/min orc.NIV (non-invasive ventilation) ord.IMV (invasive mechanical ventilation)3.Age ≥ 18 years Exclusion criteria 1.Non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation ≥ 48 hours2.Pregnancy or breast feeding3.Liver injury or failure (AST/ALT ≥ 5x ULN)4.Leukocytes < 2 × 103/μl5.Thrombocytes < 50 × 103/μl6.Severe bacterial infection (PCT > 3ng/ml)7.Acute or chronic diverticulitis8.Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, biologicals, prednisolone >10mg/d; exceptions are: prednisolone ≤ 10mg/d, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine)9.Known active or chronic tuberculosis10.Known active or chronic viral hepatitis11.Known allergic reactions to tocilizumab or its ingredients12.Life expectation of less than 1 year (independent of COVID-19)13.Participation in any other interventional clinical trial within the last 30 days before the start of this trial14.Simultaneous participation in other interventional trials (except for participation in COVID-19 trials) which could interfere with this trial; simultaneous participation in registry and diagnostic trials is allowed15.Failure to use one of the following safe methods of contraception: female condoms, diaphragm or coil, each used in combination with spermicides; intra-uterine device; hormonal contraception in combination with a mechanical method of contraception. The data collection of the primary follow up (28 days after randomisation) takes place during the hospital stay. Subsequently, a telephone interview on the quality of life is conducted after 6 and 12 months. Participants will be recruited from inpatients at ten medical centres in Germany. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention arm: Application of 8mg/kg body weight (BW) Tocilizumab i.v. once immediately after randomisation (12 mg/kg for patients with <30kg BW; total dose should not exceed 800 mg) AND conventional treatment. Control arm: Placebo (NaCl) i.v. once immediately after randomisation AND conventional treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary endpoint is the number of ventilator free days (d) (VFD) in the first 28 days after randomisation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are defined as ventilator days. VFD's are counted as zero if the patient dies within the first 28 days. RANDOMISATION: The randomisation code will be generated by the CTU (Clinical Trials Unit, ZKS Freiburg) using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. Randomisation will be stratified by centre and will be performed in blocks of variable length in a ratio of 1:1 within each centre. The block lengths will be documented separately and will not be disclosed to the investigators. The randomisation code will be produced by validated programs based on the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). BLINDING (MASKING): Participants, caregivers, and the study team assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 100 participants will be randomised to each group (thus 200 participants in total). TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version: V 1.2, 16.04.2020. Recruitment began 27th April 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by December 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered before trial start in trial registries (EudraCT: No. 2020-001408-41, registered 21st April 2020, and DRKS: No. DRKS00021238, registered 22nd April 2020).

Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment. Method: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France. We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions. Results: Patients with TCZ (n = 20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P = 0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13 L/min vs 6 L/min, P &lt; 0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P = 0.037 and higher CRP level: 158 mg/L vs 105 mg/L, P = 0.017) than patients without TCZ (n = 25). However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, P = 0.002). Conclusion: Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","COVID-19; Intensive care unit; Mortality; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Fan, G., Liu, Y., Liu, Z., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Phua, J., Weng, L., Ling, L., Egi, M., Lim, C.-M., Divatia, J.V., Intensive care management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): challenges and recommendations (2020) Lancet Respir Med; Sanders, J.M., Monogue, M.L., Jodlowski, T.Z., Cutrell, J.B., Pharmacologic treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review (2020) JAMA; Weiss, P., Murdoch, D.R., Clinical course and mortality risk of severe COVID-19 (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1014-1015; Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Zhang, J., Huang, L., Zhang, C., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Respir Med [Internet], , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164771/, [cité 26 avr 2020]; Henry, B.M., de Oliveira, M.H.S., Benoit, S., Plebani, M., Lippi, G., Hematologic, biochemical and immune biomarker abnormalities associated with severe illness and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a meta-analysis (2020) Clin Chem Lab Med; Ruan, Q., Yang, K., Wang, W., Jiang, L., Song, J., Correction to: clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China (2020) Intensive Care Med; Ye, Q., Wang, B., Mao, J., The pathogenesis and treatment of the ‘Cytokine Storm’ in COVID-19 (2020) J Infect, , [S0163445320301651]; Siddiqi, H.K., Mehra, M.R., COVID-19 Illness in native and immunosuppressed states: a clinical-therapeutic staging proposal (2020) J Heart Lung Transplant [Internet], , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118652/, [cité 29 avr 2020]; Fu, B., Xu, X., Wei, H., Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?

Here the author shows how IL-6 has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on the pathway of transduction: soluble (trans-signaling) or membrane-related (classic signaling), and suggests how targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway, with SGP130Fc, could be a better option then targeting them both. Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway. © 2020 The Author","Baricitinib; Coronavirus; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Drugs; IL-6; IL-6 trans-signaling; Interleukin-6; Ruxolitinib; SARS-CoV-1; SARS-CoV-2; SGP130Fc; Strategies; Targets; Therapies; Tocilizumab","baricitinib; be 8; clazakizumab; cp 6038; elsilimomab; glatiramer; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; Janus kinase; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; mitogen activated protein kinase; olokizumab; pf 423691; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; ruxolitinib; sarilumab; sirukumab; STAT1 protein; STAT3 protein; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiinflammatory activity; artificial intelligence; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug targeting; enzyme inhibition; epidemic; human; immunocompetent cell; inflammation; inhibition kinetics; medical decision making; nonhuman; pathogenesis; patient selection; priority journal; protein expression; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; stroma cell; virus load",,"baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; clazakizumab, 1236278-28-6; elsilimomab, 468715-71-1; glatiramer, 147245-92-9, 28704-27-0; Janus kinase, 161384-16-3; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5; olokizumab, 1007223-17-7; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, 115926-52-8; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; sirukumab, 1194585-53-9; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9","be 8; bms 945429; cnto 136; cp 6038; pf 423691",,,,,"Weiss, S.R., Leibowitz, J.L., Coronavirus pathogenesis (2011) Adv.

Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Corticosteroids; COVID-19; Immunoglobulin; Interleukin 6; Targeted therapy; Treatment","amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cell surface protein; copper; corticosteroid; glucose regulated protein 78; human monoclonal antibody; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; immunosuppressive agent; interleukin 6; ovotransferrin; proteinase; recombinant interferon; tocilizumab; virus antibody; virus glycoprotein; vitronectin; bat; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; disease severity; egg; genetic variation; human; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotherapy; inflammation; Leporidae; lung injury; nonhuman; passive immunization; plasma transfusion; priority journal; prognosis; protein cleavage; protein domain; protein glycosylation; protein protein interaction; receptor binding; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment outcome; treatment planning; virus entry; virus etiology; virus inhibition; virus load; virus neutralization; virus pathogenesis; virus replication",,"amino acid, 65072-01-7; copper, 15158-11-9, 7440-50-8; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; ovotransferrin, 1391-06-6; proteinase, 9001-92-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Cao, B., Wang, Y., Wen, D., Liu, W., Wang, J., Fan, G., A Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19 (2020) N.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. Methods: Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Results: In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were three deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and one serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Conclusion: Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cytokine; Intensive care; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, (395), pp. 497-506; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA; Wu, C., Chen, X., Cai, Y., Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Intern.

Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course. In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases. Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels ≥ 140 mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay. Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P < 0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs. normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P < 0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P < 0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P < 0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Method: A case series of COVID-19 patients with RD on disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were studied by a retrospective chart review. A literature search identified 9 similar studies of single cases and case series, which were also included. Results: There were 4 COVID-19 inpatients with RD from our hospital, and the mean age was 57 ± 21 years. Two patients had a mild infection, and 2 developed severe COVID-19 related respiratory complications, including 1 patient on secukinumab requiring mechanical ventilation and 1 patient on rituximab developing viral pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygenation. All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe COVID-19 with normal lymphocyte counts, and high levels of IL-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RD. In the literature, there were 9 studies of COVID-19 involving 197 cases of various inflammatory RD. Most patients were on DMARDs or biologics, of which TNFα inhibitors were most frequently used. Two tocilizumab users had a mild infection. Two patients were on rituximab with 1 severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. Six patients were on secukinumab with 1 hospitalization. Of the total 201 cases, 12 died, with an estimated mortality of 5.9% Conclusion: Patients with RD are susceptible to COVID-19. Various DMARDs or biologics may affect the viral disease course differently. Patients on hydroxychloroquine, TNFα antagonists or tocilizumab may have a mild viral illness. Rituximab or secukinumab could worsen the viral disease. Further study is warranted. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Biologics; COVID-19; DMARDs; Rheumatic disease; SARS CoV-2","adalimumab; amlodipine; azithromycin; canakinumab; cotrimoxazole; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; famotidine; hydrochlorothiazide; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; levothyroxine; losartan; methotrexate; metoprolol; mycophenolate mofetil; nortriptyline; olmesartan; omeprazole; oxygen; prednisone; rituximab; rosuvastatin; secukinumab; steroid; tamsulosin; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; unindexed drug; adult; African American; aged; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; artificial ventilation; case report; case study; Caucasian; clinical article; clinical feature; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome; disease exacerbation; disease predisposition; disease severity; female; hemodialysis; Hispanic; hospital discharge; human; human cell; immunosuppressive treatment; length of stay; lupus erythematosus nephritis; lymphocyte count; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; mortality; nose smear; outcome assessment; oxygen therapy; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; spondyloarthropathy; systemic lupus erythematosus; tachycardia; thorax radiography; throat culture; tracheostomy; treatment duration; virus pneumonia; Wegener granulomatosis",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; amlodipine, 88150-42-9; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; canakinumab, 402710-25-2, 402710-27-4, 914613-48-2; cotrimoxazole, 8064-90-2; etanercept, 185243-69-0, 200013-86-1, 2055118-96-0; famotidine, 76824-35-6; hydrochlorothiazide, 58-93-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; levothyroxine, 51-48-9; losartan, 114798-26-4; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; metoprolol, 37350-58-6; mycophenolate mofetil, 116680-01-4, 128794-94-5; nortriptyline, 72-69-5, 894-71-3; olmesartan, 144689-63-4; omeprazole, 73590-58-6, 95510-70-6; oxygen, 7782-44-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; rituximab, 174722-31-7; rosuvastatin, 147098-18-8, 147098-20-2; secukinumab, 875356-43-7, 875356-44-8; tamsulosin, 106133-20-4, 106138-88-9, 106463-17-6, 80223-99-0, 94666-07-6; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9","Viracor Eurofins, Lee, United States","Lee, United States",,,,"Duret, P.M., Sebbag, E., Mallick, A., Gravier, S., Spielmann, L., Messer, L., Recovery from COVID-19 in a patient with spondyloarthritis treated with TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , pii: annrheumdis-2020-217362[Epub ahead of print]; Guilpain, P., Le Bihan, C., Foulongne, V., Taourel, P., Pansu, N., Maria, A.T.J., Rituximab for granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the pandemic of covid-19: lessons from a case with severe pneumonia (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , Ann Rheum Dis. 2020 Apr 20. pii: annrheumdis-2020-217549[Epub ahead of print]; Mihai, C., Dobrota, R., Schroder, M., Garaiman, A., Jordan, S., Becker, M.O., COVID-19 in a patient with systemic sclerosis treated with tocilizumab for SSc-ILD (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, 79 (5), pp. 668-669. , Epub 2020 Apr 2; Moutsopoulos, H.M., Anti-inflammatory therapy may ameliorate the clinical picture of COVID-19 (2020) Ann Rheum Dis, , pii: annrheumdis-2020-217562[Epub ahead of print]; Favalli, E.G., Ingegnoli, F., Cimaz, R., Caporali, R., What is the true incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases?

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Indian traditional medicine; Mechanism of action; SARS-CoV-2; Therapeutic approach","Diagnosis; Hospitals; Medical applications; Risk assessment; Viruses; Coronaviruses; Current treatments; Global public health; Health-care system; Mechanism of action; Number of peoples; SARS-CoV-2; Therapeutic approach; Diseases; abacavir; arbidol; beta1a interferon; chloroquine; didanosine; eculizumab; emtricitabine; favipiravir; fingolimod; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxychloroquine sulfate; interferon beta serine; lamivudine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; methylprednisolone; nitric oxide; pirfenidone; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; sildenafil; sofosbuvir; stavudine; tenofovir disoproxil; thalidomide; tocilizumab; unindexed drug; zalcitabine; zidovudine; COVID-19; disease spread; health care; immune response; infectious disease; medicinal plant; medicine; public health; risk assessment; severe acute respiratory syndrome; symptom; virus; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; central nervous system; computer assisted tomography; conformational transition; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug classification; drug repositioning; human; Human coronavirus 229E; Human coronavirus OC43; influenza; latent period; medicinal plant; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nasopharyngeal swab; pharynx examination; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; viral clearance; virus entry; virus infectivity; virus morphology; virus mutation; virus replication; virus transmission; virus virulence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"abacavir, 136470-78-5, 188062-50-2; arbidol, 131707-23-8; beta1a interferon, 145258-61-3, 74899-71-1; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; didanosine, 69655-05-6; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; emtricitabine, 137530-41-7, 143491-54-7, 143491-57-0; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 747-36-4; interferon beta serine, 90598-63-3, 145155-23-3; lamivudine, 134678-17-4, 134680-32-3; losartan, 114798-26-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; pirfenidone, 53179-13-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; sildenafil, 139755-83-2; sofosbuvir, 1190307-88-0; stavudine, 3056-17-5; tenofovir disoproxil, 202138-50-9; thalidomide, 50-35-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; zalcitabine, 7481-89-2; zidovudine, 30516-87-1",,,"Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB: ECR/2016/001688, ECR/2018/000718

Since then, COVID-19 has become a pandemic affecting more than 1.5 million people worldwide. Patients with COVID-19 have a wide spectrum of manifestations, one being cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and its fatal correlate, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Anti-cytokine therapy such as tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, is a potential treatment for COVID-19, however data regarding the efficacy of this anti-IL-6 therapy is currently lacking. We report two cases of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 complicated by CRS treated with tocilizumab. Both patients progressed to sHLH despite treatment with tocilizumab and one developed viral myocarditis challenging the safety and clinical utility of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19-induced CRS. These cases highlight the need for clinical trials to determine optimal patient selection and timing for the use of tocilizumab during this disease process.

Like tocilizumab, Vitamin D appears to modulate the activity of an interleukin (IL-6), which may explain the seasonal variation in prevalence of influenza. While most cases of COVID-19 have, thus far, occurred in the Northern Hemisphere winter, limiting the ability to assess seasonal variation, there remains substantial variation in the severity of this condition that has yet to be explained. A retrospective comparison of Vitamin D levels in previously obtained blood samples between survivors and confirmed fatalities could establish a rationale for implementation of widespread Vitamin D supplementation. This would be far cheaper and simpler than tocilizumab as a therapeutic option to trial. © 2020",,"interleukin 1; interleukin 6; tocilizumab; vitamin D; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine production; cytokine storm; disease severity; human; immunomodulation; influenza A; Letter; seasonal variation; sunlight; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"(2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200326-sitrep-66-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=81b94e61_2, WHO Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report – 66.

The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical management; COVID-19; Environmental effect; Pandemic; Social distancing; Social lockdown","Health care; Azithromycin; CO2 emissions; Coronaviruses; Global index; Health-care system; Infection rates; Preventive measures; Self regeneration; Cobalt alloys; alcohol; azithromycin; carbon dioxide; chloroquine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; nitrogen dioxide; remdesivir; ritonavir; soap; tocilizumab; COVID-19; disease control; health care; hygiene; infectious disease; lifestyle; respiratory disease; viral disease; antiviral therapy; Bangladesh; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cost of illness; disease transmission; dynamics; environmental factor; environmental impact; France; geographic distribution; hand washing; human; India; infection control; infection prevention; infection rate; Italy; lifestyle; medical care; medication therapy management; Pakistan; priority journal; Review; social isolation; social lockdown; Spain; Sri Lanka; Switzerland; virus virulence; India; Coronavirus",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: 01.03.17, 1188/ST

Since then, the virus has rapidly spread to many countries. While the outbreak in China appears to be in decline, the disease has spread across the world, with a daily increase in the number of confirmed cases and infection-related deaths. Here, we highlight (i) the lessons that have been learnt so far and how they will benefit reducing the impact of COVID-19 disease and (ii) an update on the status of drug treatment and vaccine development to prevent COVID-19 and potential future related pandemics. Although the mortality rate is clearly higher than for influenza, the rate does seem to vary from country to country, possibly reflecting differences in how rapidly local health authorities respond to isolate and effectively care for the affected population. Drugs are urgently needed for both prophylaxis and the treatment of severely ill patients; however, no proven effective therapies for SARS-CoV-2 currently exist. A number of drugs that have been approved for other diseases are being tested for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, but there is an absence of data from appropriately designed clinical trials showing that these drugs, either alone or in combination, will prove effective. There is also a global urgency to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, but development and appropriate testing will take at least a year before such a vaccine will be globally available.

The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population. In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies. © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","Cellular therapy; Coronavirus; COVID-19; HCT; Pharmacist; Pharmacy","convalescent plasma; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; algorithm; cell therapy; clinical pharmacy; clinical practice; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; graft recipient; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; high risk patient; hospital department; hospital patient; human; immunocompromised patient; managed care; medical society; medical student; outpatient care; pandemic; patient safety; plasma transfusion; QT prolongation; resident; Review; safety procedure; telemedicine; Betacoronavirus; biological therapy; Coronavirus infection; disease management; drug effect; genetics; hospital pharmacy; organization and management; outpatient; pandemic; passive immunization; pathogenicity; practice guideline; procedures; public opinion; United States; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunization, Passive; Inpatients; Outpatients; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Pharmacy Service, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Public Opinion; Societies, Medical; Telemedicine; United States",,"hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Hydroxychloroquine","gs 5734",,"Sanofi Genzyme, Genzyme Corp.

In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being “with” rather than “by” SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither sig-nificant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, anti-inflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. (AIDS Rev. (ahead of print)). © 2020, Publicaciones Permanyer.

On December 31st 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of cases with pneumonia of unknown origin from Wuhan City, Hubei province of China. The WHO announced in February 2020 that COVID-19 is the official name of the coronavirus diseases. A total of 519,899 confirmed cases with 23,592 deaths linked to this pathogen as on March 27, 2020 have been reported. Due to increasing number of infected people across the continents and huge loss to human life, the WHO has declared the novel COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. A pandemic is defined as the ""worldwide spread"" of a new disease. Currently, no COVID-19 specific treatments have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA). However, the current treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra®), and nitazoxanide. In recent past, some natural herbal compounds have demonstrated encouraging anti-viral properties.

The sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Proper management of COVID-19 mandates better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al. describe two main features preceding severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19: the first is macrophage activation syndrome; the second is defective antigen-presentation driven by interleukin-6. An IL-6 blocker partially rescues immune dysregulation in vitro and in patients. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; dysregulation; ferritin; HLA-DR; interleukin-6; lymphopenia; macrophage activation; monocytes; respiratory failure; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"Horizon 2020: 847422

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. Methods: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” in conjunction with “otorhinolaryngological manifestation”, “ENT”, and “olfaction”. Results: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; ENT; Olfaction; Otolaryngological manifestations; SARS-CoV-2","alpha interferon; chloroquine;

In addition, many patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for thrombotic disease may develop COVID-19, which can have implications for choice, dosing, and laboratory monitoring of antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, during a time with much focus on COVID-19, it is critical to consider how to optimize the available technology to care for patients without COVID-19 who have thrombotic disease. Herein, the authors review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, epidemiology, management, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 who develop venous or arterial thrombosis, of those with pre-existing thrombotic disease who develop COVID-19, or those who need prevention or care for their thrombotic disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation","anticoagulant; antiplatelet; antithrombotic therapy; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; thrombosis","anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; antivitamin K; azithromycin; chloroquine; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; methylprednisolone; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; acute coronary syndrome; artery thrombosis; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; disease transmission; follow up; health care organization; health care personnel; health care system; heart muscle injury; hematological parameters; hemostasis; human; incidence; infection risk; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; public health; Review; thromboembolism; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; virus transmission",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,"The authors thank Kathryn Mikkelsen, MBA, from the North American Thrombosis Forum, and Adriana Vison?, MD, from the European Society of Vascular Medicine for their comments related to this initiative.

IL-6 is known to have both immunomodulatory and metabolic actions. In this letter we outline two cases of acute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab: one with elevated biomarkers consistent with acute pancreatitis the other without. Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID-19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes. The observations from our two cases highlight the complex, not fully elucidated interrelationship between elevated IL-6 and pharmacologic interventions impacting this pathway.

We review the evidence that justifies the repurposing of PARPi to block the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 and combat the life-threatening sequelae of COVID-19 by several mechanisms. PARPi’s can effectively decrease IL-6, IL-1 and TNFα levels (key interleukins in SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm) and can alleviate subsequent lung fibrosis, as demonstrated in murine experiments and clinical trials. PARPi can tune macrophages towards a tolerogenic phenotype. PARPi’s may also counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced and inflammation-induced cell death and support cell survival. PARPi’s had beneficial effects in animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma and ventilator-induced lung injury. PARPi’s may potentiate the effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Sarilumab, Adalimumab, Canakinumab or Siltuximab therapy. In summary, the evidence suggests that PARPi therapy would benefit COVID-19 patients and trials of these drugs should be undertaken. This article is protected by copyright.

TRIAL DESIGN: A phase 3 prospective, multi-center, interventional, open label, 6-arm 2x2 factorial design study. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects will be recruited at the specialized COVID-19 wards and/or ICUs at 16 Belgian participating hospitals. Only adult (≥18y old) patients will be recruited with recent (≤16 days) COVID-19 infection and acute hypoxia (defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350mmHg or PaO2/FiO2 below 280 on supplemental oxygen and immediately requiring high flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation) and signs of systemic cytokine release syndrome characterized by high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those, who have not been on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours before randomisation. Patients should have had a chest X-ray and/or CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days before randomisation. Patients with active bacterial or fungal infection will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients will be randomized to 1 of 5 experimental arms versus usual care. The experimental arms consist of Anakinra alone (anti-IL-1 binding the IL-1 receptor), Siltuximab alone (anti-IL-6 chimeric antibody), a combination of Siltuximab and Anakinra, Tocilizumab alone (humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) or a combination of Anakinra with Tocilizumab in addition to standard care. Patients treated with Anakinra will receive a daily subcutaneous injection of 100mg for a maximum of 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Siltuximab (11mg/kg) or Tocilizumab (8mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800mg) are administered as a single intravenous injection immediately after randomization. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point is the time to clinical improvement defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a six-category ordinal scale measured daily till day 28 or discharge from the hospital or death. This ordinal scale is composed of (1) Death; (2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; (3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; (4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; (5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; (6) Not hospitalized. RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). A 2x2 factorial design was selected with a 2:1 randomization regarding the IL-1 blockade (Anakinra) and a 1:2 randomization regarding the IL-6 blockade (Siltuximab and Tocilizumab). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 342 participants will be enrolled: 76 patients will receive usual care, 76 patients will receive Siltuximab alone, 76 patients will receive Tocilizumab alone, 38 will receive Anakinra alone, 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Siltuximab and 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Tocilizumab. TRIAL STATUS: COV-AID protocol version 3.0 (15 Apr 2020). Participant recruitment is ongoing and started on April 4th 2020. Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, it is difficult to anticipate the rate of participant recruitment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 1st, 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04330638) and on EudraCT on April 3rd 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001500-41).

This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. Methods: Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: Cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. Results: 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a proinflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications. © 2020 the authors.","Adverse events; Cancer; COVID-19; Immune modulation; Immune suppression","adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; baricitinib; certolizumab pegol; corticosteroid; cortisone derivative; etanercept; golimumab; ibuprofen; immunostimulating agent; immunosuppressive agent; infliximab; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; Janus kinase inhibitor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; mycophenolic acid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prednisolone; sarilumab; siltuximab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; tacrolimus; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; unindexed drug; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease marker; disease severity; down regulation; drug approval; enzyme inhibition; evidence based medicine; human; innate immunity; medical decision making; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein expression; protein targeting; Review; signal transduction; systematic review; treatment contraindication; upregulation; virus load",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; certolizumab pegol, 428863-50-7; etanercept, 185243-69-0, 200013-86-1, 2055118-96-0; golimumab, 476181-74-5; ibuprofen, 15687-27-1, 79261-49-7, 31121-93-4, 527688-20-6; infliximab, 170277-31-3; interleukin 18, 189304-55-0; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; mycophenolic acid, 23047-11-2, 24280-93-1; prednisolone, 50-24-8; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme, 151769-16-3","cimzia; enbrel; fk 506; humira; olumiant; remicade; simponi",,,,,"Zhu, W.J., Wang, J., He, X.H., The differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (2020) Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi, 42, p.

Methods: We conducted a literature review on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/, https://scholar.google.com, www.arxiv.org, www.biorxiv.org, of all articles published using the keywords COVID-19 therapy or treatment and cancer until May 2, 2020. A total of 205 articles were identified and 53 were included in this review. Results: We describe the ongoing COVID-19 therapies that should be known by oncologists and highlight the potential interactions with antineoplastic drugs, commonly used in clinical practice. The main drug interactions were found with tocilizumab, ruxolitinib and colchicine. Conclusions. The literature provides an inconclusive picture on potential preferred treatments for COVID-19 and their interactions with antineoplastic agents. Future clinical trials are needed to better understand the interactions between different drugs in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antiviral therapy; Cancer; Coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19); Drug-interactions; Management",,,,,,,,,"Akladios, C., Azais, H., Ballester, M., Bendifallah, S., Bolze, P.A., Bourdel, N., Bricou, A., Raimond, E., Touboul Recommendations for the surgical management of gynecological cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic - FRANCOGYN group for the CNGOF (2020) J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod., (Apr 1); Al-Shamsi, H.O., Alhazzani, W., Alhuraiji, A., Coomes, E.A., Chemaly, R.F., Almuhanna, M., Wolff, R., Xie, C., A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group (2020) Oncologist, (Apr 3). , [Epub ahead of print] Review; AminJafari, A., Ghasemi, S., The possible of immunotherapy for COVID-19: A systematic review (2020) Int Immunopharmacol., 83 (Apr 2), p. 106455; Covid 19 global consequences for oncology (2020) Lancet Oncology, (April); (2020), https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fda-approves-emapalumab-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis, last access. 8 april; (2020), https://www.drugs.com/history/kevzara.html, last access.8 april; (2020), https://www.drugs.com/searchterm=eculizumab, last access 8 april; (2020), https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330638, Last access 8 april; www.adnkronos.com/salute/farmaceutica/2020/04/04/coronavirus-Antiparassitario; https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/03/COVID-IHU-2-1.pdf; (2020), https://www.newsweek.com/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-france-heart-cardiac-1496810, Last access 12 april; (2020), https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/tocilizumab.html, Last access. 2 May; https://www.pharmastar.it/news/altri-studi/covid-19-a-bergamo-lo-studio-sullanticorpo-monoclonale-siltuximab-31702; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/Tocilizumab_Documenti.zip; (2020), www.http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/, Last Accessed May 2; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/RCT-TCZ-COVID19_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/TOCIVID-19_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/Sarilumab_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/Sobi.IMMUNO-101_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/TOCIVID-19_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/GS-US-540-5774_documenti.zip; (2020), https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/GS-US-540-5773_documenti.zip, Last access. 8 april; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/BARCHID_documenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/CoICoviddocumenti.zip; https://www.aifa.gov.it/documents/20142/1131319/INHIXACOVID_documenti.zip; (2020), https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1, Last Accessed May 2; (2020), last access 25 april; (2020), https://www.biorxiv.org/, Last access 25 april; (2020), https://scholar.google.com, Last access 25 april; (2020), https://www.aifa.gov.it/sperimentazioni-cliniche-covid-19, Last access. 23 april; (2020), https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01295-8, Last access 1 May; (2020), https://www.drugs.com/history/actemra.html, last Access 8 april; Banna, G., Curioni-Fontecedro, A., Friedlaender, A., Addeo, A., How we treat patients with lung cancer during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: primum non nocere (2020) ESMO Open., 5 (Apr (2)). , Review; Bersanelli, M., Controversies about COVID-19 and anticancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (2020) Immunotherapy., (Mar 26); Chatre, C., Roubille, F., Vernhet, H., Jorgensen, C., Pers, Y.M., Cardiac Complications Attributed to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine: A Systematic Review of the Literature (2018) Drug Saf., 41 (Oct (10)), pp. 919-931; Coles, C.E., Aristei, C., Bliss, J., Boersma, L., Brunt, A.M., Chatterjee, S., Hanna, G., Rivera, S., International Guidelines on Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)., 32 (May (5)), pp. 279-281; Combs, S.E., Belka, C., Niyazi, M., Corradini, S., Pigorsch, S., Wilkens, J., Grosu, A.L., Bernhardt, D., First statement on preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic in large German Speaking University-based radiation oncology departments (2020) Radiat Oncol., 15 (Apr 7(1)), p. 74. , Review; de Bono, J.S., Logothetis, C.J., Molina, A., Fizazi, K., North, S., Chu, L., Chi, K.N., Scher, H.I., Abiraterone and increased survival in metastatic prostate cancer (2011) N Engl J Med., 364 (May 26(21)), pp. 1995-2005; De Felice, F., Polimeni, A., Valentini, V., The impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) on head and neck cancer patients’ care (2020) Radiother Oncol., 147 (Mar 24), pp. 84-85; Debureaux, P.E., Arrondeau, J., Bouscary, D., Goldwasser, F., Nivolumab combined with ruxolitinib: antagonism or synergy?

METHODS: We conducted a pilot prospective open, single-arm multicentre study on off-label use of tocilizumab (TCZ) involving 63 hospitalised adult patients (56 males, age 62.6±12.5) with severe COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to-severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS: We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean±SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152±53; at day 7: 283.73±115.9, at day 14: 302.2±126, p<0.05). The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality. TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option. An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed. Future controlled trials in patients with severe illness are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with IL-6 target therapy.",,"interleukin 6 receptor; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; aged; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; female; human; male; middle aged; multicenter study; off label drug use; pandemic; pilot study; prospective study; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Off-Label Use; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Receptors, Interleukin-6; Treatment Outcome",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Receptors, Interleukin-6; tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,0392856X,,,"32359035","English","Clin.

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19.

Methods: We studied the clinical course of COVID-19 in 5 hospitalized patients with autoimmune MG (4 with acetylcholine receptor antibodies, one with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies). Results: Two patients required intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure, while one required significant supplemental oxygen. One patient with previously stable MG had myasthenic exacerbation. One patient treated with tocilizumab for COVID-19 was successfully extubated. Two patients were treated for MG with intravenous immunoglobulin without thromboembolic complications. Discussion: Our findings suggest that the clinical course and outcomes in patients with MG and COVID-19 are highly variable. Further large studies are needed to define best practices and determinants of outcomes in this unique population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

There are limited published data on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 infection among organ transplant recipients. After initial flulike symptoms, progression to an inflammatory phase may occur, characterized by cytokine release rapidly leading to respiratory and multiorgan failure. We report the clinical course and management of a liver transplant recipient on hemodialysis, who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia, and despite completing a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine, later developed marked inflammatory manifestations with rapid improvement after administration of off-label, single-dose tocilizumab. We also highlight the role of lung ultrasonography in early diagnosis of the inflammatory phase of COVID-19. Future investigation of the effects of immunomodulators among transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection will be important. This article is protected by copyright.

Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature. In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course. Recent studies proposed several theories on potential mechanisms of liver injury in these patients. This review summarizes current evidence related to hepatobiliary complications in COVID-19, provides an overview of the available case series and critically elucidates the proposed mechanisms and provides recommendations for clinicians. © Author(s) 2020.","cholangiocytes;

The disease rapidly spread all around the world in a few months and was declared a worldwide pandemic by WHO in March 2020. By April 9, there were 1,436,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, nearly with 6% mortality rate. This novel infectious disease causes respiratory tract illness that may generally occur as mild upper respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. In older patients and/or patients with underlying conditions, it may result in acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi organ failure and even death. According to the current literature, children account approximately for 1%–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Generally, COVID-19 seems to be a less severe disease for children than adults. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease. However, up to 6.7% of cases may be severe. Severe illness is generally seen in patients smaller than 1 year of age and patients who have underlying disesases. The epidemiological and clinical patterns of COVID-19 and treatment approaches in pediatric patients still remain unclear although many pediatric reports are published. This review aims to summarize the current epidemics, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. © TÜBİTAK.","COVID-19; Novel corona virus; Pediatrics","alpha2b interferon; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; C reactive protein; favipiravir; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; procalcitonin; remdesivir; tocilizumab; antivirus agent; artificial ventilation; child; computer assisted tomography; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; hospitalization; human; influenza; mortality rate; oxygen therapy; pandemic; pathogenesis; pediatric patient; plasma transfusion; pleura effusion; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; positive end expiratory pressure; respiratory distress; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; throat culture; virus transmission; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infant; laboratory technique; newborn; pathophysiology; pediatrics; preschool child; respiratory care; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pediatrics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Therapy; Risk Factors",,"alpha2b interferon, 99210-65-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antiviral Agents",,,,,,"Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) New England Journal of Medicine, 382 (13), pp. 1199-1207; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Dong, Y., Mo, X., Hu, Y., Qi, X., Jiang, F., Epidemiology of COVID-19 among children In China (2020) Pediatrics; Stoecklin, B.S., Rolland, P., Silue, Y., Mailles, A., Campese, C., (2020) Eurosurveillance; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., To, K.K., Chu, H., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 514-523; Chen, Z., Fu, J., Shu, Q., Chen, Y., Hua, C., Diagnosis and treatment recommendations for pediatric respiratory infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2020) World Journal of Pediatrics; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Coronavirus Investigating, and Research Team.

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24–72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0–2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) patients, of whom 20 (20%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a HIS. During the 10-day follow-up, three cases of severe adverse events were recorded: two patients developed septic shock and died, one had gastrointestinal perforation requiring urgent surgery and was alive at day 10. In conclusion, our series showed that COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS was characterized by HIS. The response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; female; human; Italy; male; middle aged; pandemic; prospective study; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; tocilizumab",,,,,,"Italian Ministry of Health, (2020), http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4370_1_file.pdf; Grasselli, G., Zangrillo, A., Zanella, A., Antonelli, M., Cabrini, L., Castelli, A., Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy (2020) JAMA; Grasselli, G., Pesenti, A., Cecconi, M., Critical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: early experience and forecast during an emergency response (2020) JAMA - J Am Med Assoc; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; McGonagle, D., Sharif, K., O'Regan, A., Bridgewood, C., Interleukin-6 use in COVID-19 pneumonia related macrophage activation syndrome (2020) Autoimmun Rev, 102537; Karakike, E., Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J., Macrophage activation-like syndrome: a distinct entity leading to early death in sepsis (2019) Front Immunol, 10; Lau, S.K.P., Lau, C.C.Y., Chan, K.H., Li, C.P.Y., Chen, H., Jin, D.Y., Delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of innate antiviral response by the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: implications for pathogenesis and treatment (2013) J Gen Virol, 94, pp. 2679-2690; Al-Ahmari, A., Is secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis behind the high fatality rate in Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus?

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines. © 2020, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine.","Clinical practice guidelines; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Critical illness; SARS CoV-2","tocilizumab; vasoactive agent; Article; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; health care cost; heart injury; hemodynamics; human; infection control; laboratory diagnosis; patient care; positive end expiratory pressure; practice guideline; respiratory failure; risk factor; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; systematic review (topic); virus transmission; Coronavirus infection; intensive care; intensive care unit; pandemic; practice guideline; sepsis; survivor; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sepsis; Survivors",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Liu, L., Zhong, N.S., Clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Situation Update Worldwide, 4, , https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, March 2020. 2020, March 4; Alhazzani, W., Lewis, K., Jaeschke, R., Rochwerg, B., Moller, M.H., Evans, L., Wilson, K.C., Akl, E.A., Conflicts of interest disclosure forms and management in critical care clinical practice guidelines (2018) Intensive Care Med, 44, pp. 1691-1698. , PID: 30264380; Vandvik, P.O., Alhazzani, W., Moller, M.H., Understanding conflicts of interest (2018) Intensive Care Med, 44, pp. 1738-1740. , PID: 30083991; Guyatt, G.H., Oxman, A.D., Kunz, R., Atkins, D., Brozek, J., Vist, G., Alderson, P., Schunemann, H.J., GRADE guidelines: 2.

Currently, thousands of new COVID-19 patients are quickly enrolled in clinical studies. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of the COVID-19 studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and report the extent to which they have incorporated features that are desirable for generating high-quality evidence. On April 28, 2020, a total of 945 studies on COVID-19 have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov; 586 studies are interventional (62.0%), the most frequent allocation scheme is the parallel group assignment (437; 74.6%), they are open-label and the most common primary purpose is the research on treatment. Too many of the ongoing interventional studies have a small expected sample size and may not generate credible evidence at completion. This might lead to a delayed recognition of effective therapies that are urgently needed, and a waste of time and resources. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, it is crucial that the adoption of new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies is based upon evidence coming from well-designed, adequately powered and carefully conducted clinical trials. © 2020 Piovani D et al.","2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","alpha interferon; azithromycin; beta interferon; camostat; chloroquine; favipiravir; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nitazoxanide; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; tocilizumab; Article; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; disease registry; human; infection prevention; pandemic; sample size; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; medical research; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biomedical Research; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat, 59721-28-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Sanders, J.M., Monogue, M.L., Jodlowski, T.Z., Pharmacologic Treatments for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Review (2020) JAMA, , 32282022; ClinicalTrials.gov , p. 2020. , Reference Source; Moher, D., CONSORT: an evolving tool to help improve the quality of reports of randomized controlled trials.

Since nowadays no specific drug therapies neither vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19, drug repositioning may offer a strategy to efficiently control the clinical course of the disease and the spread of the outbreak. In this paper we aim to describe the main pharmacological properties, including data on mechanism of action, safety concerns and drug-drug interactions, of drugs currently administered in patients with COVID-19, focusing on antivirals and drugs with immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 were reported. Several studies have been registered worldwide and a number of drugs were repurposed to face the new health emergency of COVID-19. For many of these drugs, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab, preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit in improving patients’ clinical conditions. However, adequate clinical trials are necessary to reach any firm conclusion on the efficacy and safety profiles of these compounds. Even though drug repurposing is necessary, it requires caution. Too many drugs that are currently tested in patients with COVID-19 have peculiar safety profiles. In conclusion, while waiting for the development of effective preventive measures, such as vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. It is conceivable that very soon their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. Results: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers or thiazolidinediones because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes. Conclusions: Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management. No definite conclusions can be made based on current limited evidence. Further research regarding this relationship and its clinical management is warranted. © 2020 The Author(s)","Clinical management; COVID-19; Diabetes; Pathogenesis; SARS-CoV-2","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; arbidol; chloroquine; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; ibuprofen; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; age; blood clotting; cardiovascular disease; chronic inflammation; chronic kidney failure; chronic lung disease; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; death; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease surveillance; flu like syndrome; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; immune deficiency; incubation time; influenza; malignant neoplasm; morbidity; mortality; mortality risk; multiple organ failure; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreas injury; pneumonia; real time polymerase chain reaction; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infectivity; virus pathogenesis; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; diabetes mellitus; pandemic; pathophysiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ibuprofen, 15687-27-1, 79261-49-7, 31121-93-4, 527688-20-6; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506. , Epub 2020/01/28.

From the pathogenetic point of view, COVID-19 mimics two other well-known diseases characterized by cytokine storm and hyper-activation of the immune response, with consequent organ damage: acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Hematologists are confident with these situations requiring a prompt therapeutic approach for switching off the uncontrolled cytokine release; here, we discuss pros and cons of drugs that are already employed in hematology in the light of their possible application in COVID-19. The most promising drugs might be: Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with a rapid and powerful anti-cytokine effect, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with their good anti-inflammatory properties, and perhaps the anti-Cd26 antibody Begelomab. We also present immunological data from gene expression experiments where TKIs resulted effective anti-inflammatory and pro-immune drugs. A possible combined treatment algorithm for COVID-19 is here proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baricitinib; Begelomab; COVID-19; GVHD; MAS; Ruxolitinib; TKIs; Tocilizumab","begelomab; bosutinib; dasatinib; ibrutinib; imatinib; immunosuppressive agent; interferon; monoclonal antibody; nilotinib; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; rituximab; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; transcriptome; algorithm; antiinflammatory activity; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug use; epidemic; gene expression; graft versus host reaction; hematologic disease; hematologist; human; immunosuppressive treatment; macrophage activation syndrome; medication therapy management; priority journal; transcriptomics",,"begelomab, 1403744-56-8; bosutinib, 380843-75-4; dasatinib, 302962-49-8, 863127-77-9; ibrutinib, 936563-96-1; imatinib, 152459-95-5, 220127-57-1; nilotinib, 641571-10-0; rituximab, 174722-31-7; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"UniversitÃ  di Pisa, UniPi","The experimental part of the work has been supported by University of Pisa with PRA 2018 grant (PI, Prof. Petrini).

Avda. de Córdoba, s/n, Madrid, Spain","Background: Information regarding the incidence and characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia amongst pregnant women is scarce. Methods: Single-centre experience with 32 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 5 to April 5, 2020 at Madrid, Spain. Findings: COVID-19 pneumonia was diagnosed in 61·5% (32/52) women. Only 18·7% (6/32) had some underlying condition (mostly asthma). Supplemental oxygen therapy was required in 18 patients (56·3%), with high-flow requirements in six (18·7%). Eight patients (25·0%) fulfilled the criteria for acute distress respiratory syndrome. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in two patients (6·2%). Tocilizumab was administered in five patients (15·6%). Delivery was precipitated due to COVID-19 in three women (9·4%). All the newborns had a favourable outcome, with no cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Severe cases of pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen were more likely to exhibit bilateral alveolar or interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray (55·6% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·003) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels >10 mg/dL (33·0% vs. 0·0%; P-value = 0·05) at admission than those with no oxygen requirements. Interpretation: Pregnant women with COVID-19 have a high risk of developing pneumonia, with a severe course in more than half of cases. The presence of bilateral kung infiltrates and elevated serum CRP at admission may identify women at-risk of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

The virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, with 96% identity to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level. COVID-19 has caused over 133,000 deaths and there are over 2 million total confirmed cases as of April 15th, 2020. Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19. One potential mechanism to slow disease progression is the use of antiviral drugs to either block the entry of the virus or interfere with viral replication and maturation. Currently, antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Due to the high dose needed and narrow therapeutic window, many patients are experiencing severe side effects with the above drugs. Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a family of natural carriers in the human body. They play a critical role in cell-to-cell communications. EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19. EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects. More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production. Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat. © 2020 by the authors.

In times of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, clinicians must deal with the question of whether immunotherapy should currently be initiated or discontinued in neurological patients. Uncertainty exists especially because different national medical associations publish different recommendations on the extent to which immunotherapies must be continued, monitored, or possibly switched during the current pandemic. Based on the most recently available data both about the novel coronavirus and the approved immunotherapies for neurological diseases, we provide an updated overview that includes current treatment strategies and the associated COVID-19 risk, but also the potential of immunotherapies to treat COVID-19. © 2020","COVID-19; Disease modifying therapies; Immunotherapies; Infections risk; Multiple sclerosis","angiotensin II; cyclic GMP; fingolimod; interferon; interleukin 1; interleukin 12; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; matrix metalloproteinase; tocilizumab; toll like receptor 7; tumor necrosis factor; acute respiratory tract disease; antiviral activity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; cytokine release; DNA synthesis; drug distribution; immune response; immunocompetent cell; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; immunotherapy; inflammation; lung injury; lung parenchyma; macrophage; nervous system inflammation; neuroimmunology; neurologic disease; pleiotropy; priority journal; receptor down regulation; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"angiotensin II, 11128-99-7, 68521-88-0; cyclic GMP, 7665-99-8; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease. The Notch signalling is a major regulator of cardiovascular function and it is also implicated in several biological processes mediating viral infections. In this report we discuss the possibility to target Notch signalling to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and interfere with the progression of COVID-19- associated heart and lungs disease. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ADAM17; Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus disease; COVID-19; Furin; Notch","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; estradiol; fluorouracil; furin; Notch receptor; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; ADAM17 protein, human; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; furin; interleukin 6; Notch receptor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; colorectal cancer; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine storm; disease association; Editorial; heart disease; heart failure; human; hypertension; immune response; infection prevention; inflammation; lung disease; nonhuman; Notch signaling; respiratory failure; risk factor; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug effect; heart arrest; heart disease; heart failure; immunology; lung disease; metabolism; myocarditis; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; signal transduction; virology; ADAM17 Protein; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Furin; Heart Arrest; Heart Diseases; Heart Failure; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lung Diseases; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Notch; Signal Transduction",,"dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; estradiol, 50-28-2; fluorouracil, 51-21-8; furin; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme, 151769-16-3; ADAM17 Protein; ADAM17 protein, human; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Furin; Interleukin-6; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Receptors, Notch","CytoSorb",,,,,"Agata, J., Ura, N., Yoshida, H., Shinshi, Y., Sasaki, H., Hyakkoku, M., Taniguchi, S., Shimamoto, K., Olmesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker with an inhibitory effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (2006) Hypertens Res, 29, pp. 865-874; Aquila, G., Kostina, A., Vieceli Dalla Sega, F., Shlyakhto, E., Kostareva, A., Marracino, L., Ferrari, R., Malaschicheva, A., The Notch pathway: a novel therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases?

Many older drugs are being investigated for repurposing against COVID-19. We comment on various drugs currently undergoing such trials to optimize their safe use. Comment: We describe medications used during early COVID-19 outbreaks in South Korea, focusing on practice aspects including the method of drug administration, drug formulation, patient-monitoring for adverse reactions and drug interactions informed by our experience during the 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We comment on hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir with zinc supplement, remdesivir, tocilizumab, ciclesonide, niclosamide and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). What is new and conclusion: Effective therapies are urgently needed to manage COVID-19, and existing drugs such as antivirals and antimalarials are under investigation for repurposing to meet this need. This process requires up-to-date drug information to ensure optimum use, particularly safety and efficacy profiles of the medications, until convincing evidence is reported. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","COVID-19; investigational medication; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome",,,,,,,,,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report 74, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200403-sitrep-74-covid-19-mp.pdf?sfvrsn=4e043d03_4, Accessed March 28, 2020; McMichael, T., Currie, D.W., Clark, S., Epidemiology of Covid-19 in a Long-Term Care Facility in King County, Washington (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (21), pp. 2005-2011; Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected: Interim guidance V 1.2, , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf, Accessed March 23, 2020; Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 infection, , https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-treatment-and-management/, Accessed April 13, 2020; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1β, -6, and TNF-α) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I IFN response, the theoretical role of IL-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe COVID-19 (i.e. interleukin-1β-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anakinra; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; IL-1; IL-6; Sars-CoV2; Tocilizumab; Type-I interferon","cytokine; IL1B protein, human; IL6 protein, human; interferon; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; human; immunology; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Interferons; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"Cytokines; IL1B protein, human; IL6 protein, human; Interferons; Interleukin-1beta; Interleukin-6",,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet Lond Engl, 395, pp. 565-574; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Fan, G., Liu, Y., Liu, Z., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet Lond Engl, 395, pp. 1054-1062; Grasselli, G., Zangrillo, A., Zanella, A., Antonelli, M., Cabrini, L., Castelli, A., Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy (2020) JAMA; Siddiqi, H.K., Mehra, M.R., COVID-19 illness in native and immunosuppressed states: a clinical-therapeutic staging proposal (2020) J Heart Lung Transplant, , 0; Fu, L., Wang, B., Yuan, T., Chen, X., Ao, Y., Fitzpatrick, T., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2020) J Infect; Rivellese, F., Prediletto, E., ACE2 at the centre of COVID-19 from paucisymptomatic infections to severe pneumonia (2020) Autoimmun Rev, 102536; Donoghue, M., Hsieh, F., Baronas, E., Godbout, K., Gosselin, M., Stagliano, N., A novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 (2000) Circ Res, 87, pp. E1-E9; Yang, X., Yu, Y., Xu, J., Shu, H., Xia, J., Liu, H., Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study (2020) Lancet Respir Med; Guan, W.-J., Ni, Z.-Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.-H., Ou, C.-Q., He, J.-X., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Zhang, J.-J., Dong, X., Cao, Y.-Y., Yuan, Y.-D., Yang, Y.-B., Yan, Y.-Q., Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China (2020) Allergy; Fang, L., Karakiulakis, G., Roth, M., Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?

Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines “cytokine storm” leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm. © TÜBİTAK.","Antiinflammatory;

Currently, there are no proven effective vaccines or therapeutic agents against the virus. Current clinical management includes infection prevention and control measures and supportive care including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support. Evolving research and clinical data regarding the virologic SARS-CoV-2 suggest a potential list of repurposed drugs with appropriate pharmacological effects and therapeutic efficacies in treating COVID-19 patients. In this review, we will update and summarize the most common and plausible drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. These drugs and therapeutic agents include antiviral agents (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, umifenovir, favipiravir, and oseltamivir), and supporting agents (Ascorbic acid, Azithromycin, Corticosteroids, Nitric oxide, IL-6 antagonists), among others. We hope that this review will provide useful and most updated therapeutic drugs to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19 patients until the approval of vaccines and specific drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anakinra; Azithromycin; Chloroquine; Convalescent plasma; COVID-19; Epoprostenol; Favipiravir; Hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir; Methylprednisolone; Nitric oxide; Oseltamivir; Remdesivir; SAR-CoV-2; Sarilumab; Sirolimus; Tocilizumab; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Umifenovir; Vitamin C",,,,,,"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, NCCIH

A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 µg/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 µg/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 µg/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 µg/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 µg/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in COVID-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to COVID-19 Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in COVID-19 remain unclear. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anticoagulation; COVID-19; Ophthalmic artery occlusion; Stroke","antibiotic agent; apixaban; D dimer; enoxaparin; hydroxychloroquine; tocilizumab; acute respiratory failure; adult; anticoagulant therapy; artery occlusion; Article; blood level; candidiasis; case report; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; fever; fungemia; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; hypoxemia; kidney injury; lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; ophthalmic artery; priority journal; prophylaxis; respiratory failure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; thrombocytosis; visual impairment",,"apixaban, 503612-47-3; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"UL1-RR025008

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the newly evolving human coronavirus infection that causes COVID-19, and it first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly all over the world. COVID-19 is being increasingly investigated through virology, epidemiology, and clinical management strategies. There is currently no established consensus on the standard of care in the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, certain medications suggested for other diseases have been shown to be potentially effective for treating this infection, though there has yet to be clear evidence. Therapies include new agents that are currently tested in several clinical trials, in addition to other medications that have been repurposed as antiviral and immune-modulating therapies. Previous high-morbidity human coronavirus epidemics such as the 2003 SARS-CoV and the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) prompted the identification of compounds that could theoretically be active against the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, advances in molecular biology techniques and computational analysis have allowed for the better recognition of the virus structure and the quicker screening of chemical libraries to suggest potential therapies. This review aims to summarize rationalized pharmacotherapy considerations in COVID-19 patients in order to serve as a tool for health care professionals at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. All the reviewed therapies require either additional drug development or randomized large-scale clinical trials to be justified for clinical use. © 2020 by the authors.

After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by an 11- year-old SARS-CoV-2-positive female who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission. © 2020","Child; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Enoxaparin; Pediatric; Remdesivir; Septic; Shock; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,"Special thanks to the Kings County Hospital Center Emergency Department staff for their dedication and strength during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Dong, E., Du, H., Gardner, L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, 20 (5), pp. 533-534; Lu, X., Zhang, L., Du, H., SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (17), pp. 1663-1665; Ludvigsson, J.F., Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults (2020) Acta Paediatr, 109 (6), pp. 1088-1095; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00432.asp, (Accessed 26 May 2020); Balasubramanian, S., Nagendran, T.M., Ramachandran, B., Ramanan, A.V., Hyper-inflammatory syndrome in a child with COVID-19 treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and tocilizumab (2020) Indian Pediatr, , published online ahead of print, 2020 May 10 [S097475591600180]; Verdoni, L., Mazza, A., Gervasoni, A., An outbreak of severe Kawasaki-like disease at the Italian epicentre of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: an observational cohort study [published online ahead of print, 2020 May 13].

Statements from front-line experts in the field of intensive care are urgently needed. Methods: Sixteen front-line experts in China fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan were organized to develop an expert statement after 5 rounds of expert seminars and discussions to provide trustworthy recommendation on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Each expert was assigned tasks within their field of expertise to provide draft statements and rationale. Parts of the expert statement are based on epidemiological and clinical evidence, without available scientific evidences. Results: A comprehensive document with 46 statements are presented, including protection of medical personnel, etiological treatment, diagnosis and treatment of tissue and organ functional impairment, psychological interventions, immunity therapy, nutritional support, and transportation of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Among them, 5 recommendations were strong (Grade 1), 21 were weak (Grade 2), and 20 were experts’ opinions. A strong agreement from voting participants was obtained for all recommendations. Conclusion: There are still no targeted therapies for COVID-19 patients. Dynamic monitoring and supportive treatment for the restoration of tissue vascularization and organ function are particularly important. © 2020, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Critical care; Expert statement","glucocorticoid;

Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization. This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection. Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect. The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Autoimmunity; Biologics; Coronavirus; COVID-19; DMARDs; IL-6; Immunosuppressant.

It involves the respiratory system and other organs like kidney, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system as well. The recent reports indicated that renal disorder is prevalent in coronavirus patients. The aim of this study was to provide a review of nephropathy caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its mechanisms. The Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched. Articles reporting nephropathy, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), coronavirus and the renal injury were included for assessment. Study designs, contrast agents, case reports and results were assessed. Of the assessed studies, suggested mechanisms include sepsis which caused cytokine storm syndrome or perhaps direct cellular injury due to the virus. In patients who were studied, albuminuria, proteinuria, and hematuria as well as an elevation in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed. Additionally CT scan of the kidneys showed a decrease in tissue density suggestive of inflammation and interstitial edema. On the other hand, dialysis patients are a high-risk group than the general population. The current treatment for COVID-19 in acute kidney injury includes supportive management or kidney replacement therapy. All patients need to be quarantined. An N95 fit-tested mask and protective clothing and proper equipment are necessary. Some drugs can be effective to inhibit the outcome of this infection such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesvir, Chloroquine phosphate, convalescent plasma, tocilizumab, ACEi/ ARBs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers), and hrsACE2 (human recombinant soluble angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2). © 2020 The Author(s);.","Angiotensin converting enzyme; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Kidney; Nephropathy","angiotensin receptor antagonist; chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; tocilizumab; virus spike protein; albuminuria; antiviral therapy; case fatality rate; cell damage; computer assisted tomography; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; dialysis; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; hematuria; human; hypertension; incubation time; kidney; kidney injury; leukocytosis; lymphocytopenia; proteinuria; Review; rhinorrhea; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; urea nitrogen blood level; virus transmission",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Gorbalenya, A.E., Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus – The species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2020) Biorxiv; Jin, Y.H., Cai, L., Cheng, Z.S., Cheng, H., Deng, T., Fan, Y.P., A rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (2020) Mil Med Res., 7 (1), p. 4.; Li, Y., Bai, W., Hashikawa, T., The neuroinvasive potential of SARS‐CoV2 may be at least partially responsible for the respiratory failure of COVID‐19 patients (2020) J Med Virol., 9 (4); Li, Y., Yao, L., Li, J., Chen, L., Song, Y., Cai, Z., Stability issues of RT-PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 for hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 (2020) J Med Virol; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733; Fauci, A.S., Lane, H.C., Redfield, R.R., Covid-19 — Navigating the Uncharted (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (13), pp. 1268-1269; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Peiris, J., Chu, C., Cheng, V., Chan, K., Hung, I., Poon, L., Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: A prospective study (2003) Lancet, 361 (9371), pp. 1767-1772; Li, Z., Wu, M., Guo, J., Yao, J., Guo, J., Liao, X., Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients (2020) Medrxiv; Cheng, Y., Luo, R., Wang, K., Zhang, M., Wang, Z., Dong, L., Kidney impairment is associated with in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients (2020) Medrxiv; Li, W., Moore, M.J., Vasilieva, N., Sui, J., Wong, S.K., Berne, M.A., Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus (2003) Nature, 426 (6965), pp. 450-454; Hamming, I., Timens, W., Bulthuis, M., Lely, A., Navis, G., van Goor, H., Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus.

While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, with a 3–6% mortality. A plethora of treatments has been or is being assessed, but to date, none has been proven effective. Management is mainly symptomatic, with organ support for the critically ill. Several reports, mainly case series, from across the world have concluded that patients with malignancy appear more susceptible to severe infection and mortality from COVID-19. This could be attributed to immunosuppression, co-existing medical conditions and underlying pulmonary compromise which is often the case in lung malignancy. Patients with haematological cancer and those who are receiving active chemotherapy treatment may be at greatest risk due to increased immunosuppression. This pandemic tested the resilience of worldwide health-care systems in an unprecedented manner. It has forced oncologists to rethink the entire diagnostic and therapeutic process, based on the local prevalence and impact of COVID-19. In this review we will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients affected by cancer, their diagnosis and management, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress symptoms and currently investigated treatment approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Covid-19; Immunotherapy; Mortality; NSCLC","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; canakinumab; chloroquine; corticosteroid; gamma interferon; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrophage inflammatory protein; monocyte chemotactic protein; ruxolitinib; siltuximab; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; biological therapy; blood transfusion; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; health care management; herd immunity; human; malignant neoplasm; pandemic; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); protein blood level; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; canakinumab, 402710-25-2, 402710-27-4, 914613-48-2; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Al-Qahtani, A.A., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2): emergence, history, basic and clinical aspects (2020) Saudi J Biol Sci; (2019), WHO.

The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected. To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill. While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use. This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adjunctive treatment;

The infection, transmitted by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first discovered in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then rapidly spread worldwide. Italy was early and severely involved, with a critical spread of the infection and a very high number of victims. Person-to-person spread mainly occurs via respiratory droplets and contact. The median incubation period is 5 days. The spectrum of respiratory symptoms may range from mild to severe, strictly depending on the age of the patient and the underlying comorbidities. In children COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age. For patients affected by rheumatic disease, despite the concerns related to the imbalance of their immune response and the effect of immunosuppressive treatments, there are still few data to understand the real consequences of this infection. Major scientific societies have issued recommendations to help rheumatologists in caring their patients. Interestingly, some of the drugs mostly used by rheumatologists appear to be promising in critical COVID-19 infected patients, where the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm seem to drive to the multiorgan failure. Pediatric rheumatologists are expected to play a supporting role in this new front of COVID-19 pandemic, both as general pediatricians treating infected children, and as rheumatologists taking care of their rheumatic patients, as well as offering their experience in the possible alternative use of immunomodulatory drugs. © 2020 The Author(s).","2019-nCoV; Children; COVID-19; Italy; Respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2","anakinra; chloroquine; emapalumab; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; antirheumatic agent; interleukin 6; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; human; incubation time; infection risk; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; pandemic; pediatric rheumatologist; priority journal; Review; rheumatologist; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus characterization; virus transmission; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; child; clinical trial (topic); complication; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; infant; Italy; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; pediatrician; preschool child; rheumatic disease; rheumatologist; virology; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Juvenile; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child, Preschool; Chloroquine; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Infant; Interleukin-6; Italy; Pandemics; Pediatricians; Pneumonia, Viral; Rheumatic Diseases; Rheumatologists",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; emapalumab, 1709815-23-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antirheumatic Agents; Chloroquine; Hydroxychloroquine; Interleukin-6",,,,,,"The Species Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus: Classifying 2019-nCoV and Naming It SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Nat Microbiol, , Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, (in press); Zhao, S., Lin, Q., Ran, J., Musa, S.S., Guangpu Yang, G., Et Al.

Environmental factors such as air pollution and smoking and comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and underlying cardio-respiratory illness) likely increase the severity of COVID-19. Rheumatic manifestations such as arthralgias and arthritis may be prevalent in about a seventh of individuals. COVID-19 can result in acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia (with lymphopenia) and thrombocytopenia, also seen in rheumatic diseases like lupus and Sjogren’s syndrome. Severe disease in a subset of patients may be driven by cytokine storm, possibly due to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), akin to that in systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis or adult-onset Still’s disease. In the absence of high-quality evidence in this emerging disease, understanding of pathogenesis may help postulate potential therapies. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) appears important for viral entry into pneumocytes; dysbalance in ACE2 as caused by ACE inhibitors or ibuprofen may predispose to severe disease. Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Antiviral drugs like lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir and remdesivir are also being explored. Cytokine storm and secondary HLH might require heightened immunosuppressive regimens. Current international society recommendations suggest that patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapy should not stop glucocorticoids during COVID-19 infection, although minimum possible doses may be used. Disease-modifying drugs should be continued; cessation may be considered during infection episodes as per standard practices. Development of a vaccine may be the only effective long-term protection against this disease.Key Points• Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) may have features mimicking rheumatic diseases, such as arthralgias, acute interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and cytokine storm with features akin to secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.• Although preliminary results may be encouraging, high-quality clinical trials are needed to better understand the role of drugs commonly used in rheumatology like hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19.• Until further evidence emerges, it may be cautiously recommended to continue glucocorticoids and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients receiving these therapies, with discontinuation of DMARDs during infections as per standard practice. © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Hydroxychloroquine; Hypothesis; Immunity; Pathogenesis; Vaccines; Vitamin D",,,,,,,,,"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, COVID-19 cases worldwide, Accessed on 29 Mar 2020; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , (,),.,., https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032; Habibzadeh, P., Stoneman, E.K., The novel coronavirus: a Bird's eye view (2020) Int J Occup Environ Med, 11, pp. 65-71; https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200328-sitrep-68-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=384bc74c_2.2, Updated on 28 March 2020.

We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular considerations of therapies currently used, including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, ribavirin, interferons, and lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as experimental therapies, such as human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2), are discussed.

While cardiac injury has been demonstrated in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential mechanisms of myocardial injury due to viral toxicities and host immune responses. Recent Findings: A number of studies have reported an epidemiological association between history of cardiac disease and worsened outcome during COVID infection. Development of new onset myocardial injury during COVID-19 also increases mortality. While limited data exist, potential mechanisms of cardiac injury include direct viral entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and toxicity in host cells, hypoxia-related myocyte injury, and immune-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Potential treatments for reducing viral infection and excessive immune responses are also discussed. Summary: COVID patients with cardiac disease history or acquire new cardiac injury are at an increased risk for in-hospital morbidity and mortality. More studies are needed to address the mechanism of cardiotoxicity and the treatments that can minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cardiac injury; Cardiovascular system; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Immune response; SARS-CoV-2","adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; chloroquine; CXCL11 chemokine; CXCL9 chemokine; eculizumab; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glucocorticoid; granzyme B; hemagglutinin esterase protein; HLA DR antigen; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 2; lopinavir plus ritonavir; M protein; nucleocapsid protein; perforin; remdesivir; sarilumab; serine proteinase; TMPRSS2 protein; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; viral protein; virus envelope protein; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; adaptive immunity; adult respiratory distress syndrome; age; antigen presentation; B lymphocyte; cardiotoxicity; CD3+ T lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; endothelial dysfunction; endothelial inflammation; ferritin blood level; heart muscle injury; human; immune response; infection rate; inflammation; innate immunity; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; myocarditis; natural killer cell; nonhuman; protein blood level; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; T lymphocyte activation; Th17 cell; toxicity; viral toxicity; virus entry; virus load; virus pathogenesis; virus replication; animal; Betacoronavirus; cardiac muscle cell; complication; Coronavirus infection; heart disease; hypoxia; immunology; metabolism; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Heart Diseases; Humans; Hypoxia; Myocytes, Cardiac; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; granzyme B; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; perforin, 119332-27-3; proprotein convertase 9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; serine protease HTRA1; serine proteinase, 37259-58-8; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Cytokines; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",,,"American Heart Association, AHA: 17EIA33410923

The optimal management of patients infected with COVID-19 is still unclear, although the consensus is moving toward the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7–10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent, with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anticytokine drugs) may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach used in Brescia (Italy) for managing patients infected with COVID-19 who underwent kidney transplantation and are receiving hemodialysis.

This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy. © 2020 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","Cellular therapy; Chimeric antigen receptor T cells; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic",,,,,,"Novartis

The virus is highly contagious with potential human-human transmission which was named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across six continents and emerged as a global pandemic in short span with alarming levels of spread and severity. This virus associated symptoms and infectious respiratory illness is designated as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 possesses enveloped club-like spike protein projections with positive-sense large RNA genome and has a unique replication strategy. This virus was believed to have zoonotic origin with genetical identity to bat and pangolin CoV. In the current review, we introduce a general overview about the human CoVs and the associated diseases, the origin, structure, replication and key clinical events that occur in the COVID-19 pathogenicity. Furthermore, we focused on possible therapeutic options such as repurposing drugs including antimalarials, antivirals, antiparasitic drugs, and anti-HIV drugs, as well as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines as potential treatment options. Also we have summarized the latest research progress on the usage of stem cell therapy, human convalescent serum, interferon's, in the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020","COVID-19; Repurposing drugs; SARS-CoV-2; Spike proteins; Zoonotic origin","andrographolide; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antibiotic agent; azithromycin; BCG vaccine; bevacizumab; carrimycin; chloroquine; ciprofloxacin; consensus interferon; coumamycin; curcumin; hydroxychloroquine; ivermectin; lisinopril; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; mRNA 1273 vaccine; niclosamide; nimbolide; oseltamivir; quercetin; remdesivir; ribavirin; ritonavir; RNA vaccine; sarilumab; sofosbuvir; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; adult respiratory distress syndrome; allergy; amniotic fluid cell; anemia; antiviral activity; Article; blurred vision; bradycardia; chill; clinical feature; convalescent plasma; Coronaviridae; coronavirus disease 2019; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; fever; human; hyperlipidemia; immunogenicity; incubation time; insomnia; isolation; liver toxicity; loss of appetite; malaria; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; natural killer cell; nonhuman; pandemic; phylogeny; plasma; QT prolongation; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stem cell transplantation; symptom; virus entry; virus genome; virus morphology; virus particle; virus replication; virus transmission; virus virulence; zoonosis",,"andrographolide, 5508-58-7; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; bevacizumab, 216974-75-3, 1438851-35-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; ciprofloxacin, 85721-33-1; coumamycin, 4434-05-3, 78040-85-4; curcumin, 458-37-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; ivermectin, 70288-86-7; lisinopril, 76547-98-3, 83915-83-7; losartan, 114798-26-4; niclosamide, 50-65-7; nimbolide, 25990-37-8; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; quercetin, 117-39-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; sofosbuvir, 1190307-88-0; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,"Authors sincerely acknowledge Director, NIPER-Hyderabad , India and Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP), Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers , Government of India for financial support.",,"Viruses in biology https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-012-0441-y, SpringerLink (n.d.)

Originating in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread and impacted subsets of populations with initial unclear risk factors contributing to worsening morbidity and mortality. Patients with diagnosis of cancer and undergoing treatment further represent a population at risk for worsening cardiopulmonary outcomes. This review explores specific risk factors, diagnoses, and treatment options that impact cardio-oncologic patients with COVID-19. Recent Findings: Multiple studies globally, including Italy, China, and the USA, have documented severe outcomes. Cancer patients are at increased risk of cardiac injury which itself is a risk factor for mortality. Additionally, elderly cancer patients undergoing recent anti-cancer treatment may be at greater risk for sustaining worse outcomes, although data remains suboptimal in this population. Major gaps remain regarding risk associated with type of cancer and type of anti-cancer treatment, as well as the layered risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Immunomodulatory therapies used to treat cytokine release syndrome secondary to anti-cancer therapies, as well as other agents being traditionally used to treat cardiovascular and cancer disease states, are being investigated for treatment of COVID-19. Summary: Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer have been associated with more severe COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes. Patients undergoing anti-cancer therapy or those who have suffered from coronavirus infection may develop long-standing changes, not limited to pulmonary fibrosis, hyperlipidemia, and worsening atherosclerosis. Those undergoing anti-cancer therapy are at theoretically increased susceptibility for infection, with type of cancer not necessarily dictating outcome. A review of the literature of patients with cardiovascular and/or cancer disease is presented, as well as proposed strategies to attenuate risk regarding treatment, management, and surveillance in this vulnerable population. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cancer; Cardio-oncology; Cardiovascular disease; COVID-19","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anthracycline; chemokine receptor CCR5; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; erlotinib; heparin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; leronlimab; sarilumab; simvastatin; sunitinib; thromboplastin; tocilizumab; vasculotropin inhibitor; anticoagulation; breast cancer; cancer immunotherapy; cancer therapy; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; China; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; dengue; disease severity; disease transmission; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; high risk population; human; hypertension; immune related adverse event; immunopathology; infection risk; ischemia; Italy; kidney carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; pandemic; patient care; pneumonia; prevalence; prognosis; renal cell carcinoma; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; telemedicine; thrombosis; United States; Betacoronavirus; cardiology; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; Coronavirus infection; neoplasm; oncology; physiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiology; Cardiotoxicity; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors",,"erlotinib, 183319-69-9, 183321-74-6; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; leronlimab, 674782-26-4; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; simvastatin, 79902-63-9; sunitinib, 341031-54-7, 557795-19-4; thromboplastin, 9035-58-9; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6, COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University., Last accessed May 13, 2020; WHO Director-General’s opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 (2020) Published March 11, p. 2020. , https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19%2D%2D-11-march-2020, 11 March, Accessed April 09, 2020; Chan, P.K., Toe, W.K., Ng, K.C., Lam, R.K., Ng, T.K., Chan, R.C., Wu, A., Lai, S.T., Laboratory diagnosis of SARS (2004) Emerg Infect Dis, 10 (5), p. 825. , PID: 15200815; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature., 579 (7798), pp. 270-273. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXksFKlsLg%3D, PID: 7095418; de Groot, R.J., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., Brown, C.S., Drosten, C., Enjuanes, L., Fouchier, R.A., Perlman, S., Commentary: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2013) J Virol, 87 (14), pp. 7790-7792. , PID: 23678167; Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 470-473. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXnsVaisLg%3D, PID: 31986257; Yeo, C., Kaushal, S., Yeo, D., Enteric involvement of coronaviruses: is faecal–oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 possible?

Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7-10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5-10.5 days with mortality of around 1-2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","2019-nCoV; Chinese Medicine; COVID-19; Guideline; Integrative Medicine; Review","arbidol; ba bao dan capsule; Chinese drug; cobicistat; da yuan decoction; darunavir; favipiravir; fingolimod; glucocorticoid; honeysuckle decoction; hua tan zhi ke granule; huo pu xia ling decoction; huo xiang zheng qi powder; jing ye bai du granule; kang bing du granule; ke su ting syrup; leflunomide; lian hua qing wen capsule; lopinavir plus ritonavir; methylprednisolone; qing fei pai du decoction; remdesivir; riamilovir; sheng jiang powder; shuang huang lian; tan re qing injection; tocilizumab; tranilast; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; xue bi jing injection; 2009 H1N1 influenza; allopathy; Article; Chinese medicine; clinical feature; computer model; coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based practice; human; integrative medicine; practice guideline; qigong; severe acute respiratory syndrome; western medicine; Betacoronavirus; clinical trial (topic); Coronavirus infection; pandemic; pathology; practice guideline; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; cobicistat, 1004316-88-4; darunavir, 206361-99-1, 635728-49-3; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; leflunomide, 75706-12-6; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; riamilovir, 123606-06-4, 928659-17-0; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tranilast, 53902-12-8",,,"Health and Medical Research Fund, HMRF: 14151731","We thank Ms. Kam Yan Yu for clerical support on the translation of herbs.

It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and no effective therapies currently exist against this novel viral agent. Along with extensive public health measures, an unprecedented global effort in identifying effective drugs for the treatment is being implemented. Potential drug targets are emerging as the result of a fast-evolving understanding of SARS-CoV-2 virology, host response to the infection, and clinical course of the disease. This brief review focuses on the latest and most promising pharmacological treatments against COVID-19 currently under investigation and discuss their potential use based on either documented efficacy in similar viral infections, or their activity against inflammatory syndromes. Ongoing clinical trials are also emphasized. © Mattioli 1885.","Antivirals; COVID-19; Drugs; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy","anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; baricitinib; camostat mesilate;

As its worldwide expansion, the virus has presented mutations and therefore phenotypic variants that have generated clinical pictures that are far from the symptoms described initially; rather, coagulation disturbances and intense inflammation (cytokine storm) have created atypical symptoms and different therapeutic approaches; placing ferritin and D-dimer as cardinal biomarkers to decide anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory therapy such as corticotherapy, monoclonal anti IL6 Tocilizumab or methotrexate, among others. Below we present the case of a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 with RT-PCR, who shows more than his respiratory manifestations. This prothrombotic state triggered intravascular thrombosis and possibly pulmonary embolism, with elevated values of ferritin and D-dimer, which after anticoagulation and administration of corticosteroids exceeded his state of extreme gravity and discharged from Intensive Care. © 2020 Revista Bionatura.

The early diagnosis and management of the disease remains a major challenge. In this review, we aim to summarize the updated epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A broad search of the literature was performed in “PubMed” “Medline” “Web of Science”, “Google Scholar” and “World Health Organization-WHO” using the keywords “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19, “SARS”, “SARS-CoV-2” “Epidemiology” “Transmission” “Pathogenesis” “Clinical Characteristics”. We reviewed and documented the information obtained from literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The global cases of COVID-19 as of April 2, 2020, have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness. Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from an underlying chronic medical condition like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory illness or cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-Cov-2 has emerged as a worldwide threat, currently affecting 170 countries and territories across the globe. There is still much to be understood regarding SARS-CoV-2 about its virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies; this knowledge will be essential to both manage the current pandemic and to conceive comprehensive measures to prevent such outbreaks in the future. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

This, in addition to the older age of onset and the higher rate of hospitalization compared to multiple sclerosis, makes this patient group a potential target for complicated COVID-19 infection. Moreover, many of the commonly used preventive therapies for NMOSD are cell-depleting immunouppsressants with increased risk of viral and bacterial infections. The emergence of several new NMOSD therapeutics, including immune-modulating agents, concurrently with the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic call for careful therapeutic planning and add to the complexity of NMOSD management. Altering the common therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the pandemic may be necessary to balance both efficacy and safety of treatment. Selection of preventive therapy should take in consideration the viral exposure risk related to the route and frequency of administration and, most importantly, the immunological properties of each therapeutic agent and its potential impact on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and severity of infection. The impact of the therapeutic agent on the immune response against the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should also be considered in the clinical decision-making. In this review, we will discuss the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and evaluate the potential impact of the current and emerging NMOSD therapeutics on infection risk, infection severity, and future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We propose a therapeutic approach to NMOSD during the COVID-19 pandemic based on analysis of the mechanism of action, route of administration, and side effect profile of each therapeutic agent. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19; Immunotherapy; Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; NMOSD; SARS-CoV-2","azathioprine; corticosteroid; eculizumab; immunoglobulin; inebilizumab; mycophenolate mofetil; ocrelizumab; placebo; prednisone; rituximab; satralizumab; tocilizumab; B cell lymphoma; bacterial pneumonia; bronchitis; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug mechanism; drug megadose; flu like syndrome; hepatitis B; human; humoral immunity; immune response; immunoglobulin deficiency; immunosuppressive treatment; infection; infection risk; influenza; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; meningococcosis; multiple sclerosis; myelooptic neuropathy; neutropenia; nonhuman; pancytopenia; pandemic; pharyngitis; plasma exchange; pneumonia; respiratory tract infection; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; rhinopharyngitis; risk factor; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tuberculosis; upper respiratory tract infection; viral upper respiratory tract infection",,"azathioprine, 446-86-6; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; inebilizumab, 1299440-37-1; mycophenolate mofetil, 116680-01-4, 128794-94-5; ocrelizumab, 637334-45-3; prednisone, 53-03-2; rituximab, 174722-31-7; satralizumab, 1535963-91-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA

Today, it is a pandemic infection, and even if several compounds are used as curative or supportive treatment, there is not a definitive treatment. In particular, antiviral treatment used for the treatment of several viral infections (eg, hepatitis C, HIV, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus) are today used with a mild or moderate effect on the lung injury. In fact, ALI seems to be related to the inflammatory burst and release of proinflammatory mediators that induce intra-alveolar fibrin accumulation that reduces the gas exchange. Therefore, an add-on therapy with drugs able to reduce inflammation, edema, and cell activation has been proposed as well as a treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or monoclonal antibodies (eg, tocilizumab). In this article reviewing literature data related to the use of escin, an agent having potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects in lung injury, we suggest that it could represent a therapeutic opportunity as add-on therapy in ALI related to COVID-19 infection. © 2020, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology","acute lung injury; coronavirus-2; COVID-19; escin; pneumonia",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733; Rothan, H.A., Byrareddy, S.N., The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak (2020) J Autoimmun, 109; Sanders, J.M., Monogue, M.L., Jodlowski, T.Z., Cutrell, J.B., Pharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.6019, [published online ahead of print April 13, 2020]; Cao, X., COVID-19: immunopathology and its implications for therapy (2020) Nat Rev Immunol, 20 (5), pp. 269-270; Li, G., Fan, Y., Lai, Y., Coronavirus infections and immune responses (2020) J Med Virol, 92 (4), pp. 424-432; Fu, Y., Cheng, Y., Wu, Y., Understanding SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses: from mechanisms to potential therapeutic tools Virol Sin, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00207-4, [published online ahead of print March 3, 2020]; Ye, Q., Wang, B., Mao, J., The pathogenesis and treatment of the ‘Cytokine Storm’ in COVID-19 (2020) J Infect; Channappanavar, R., Perlman, S., Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology (2017) Semin Immunopathol, 39 (5), pp. 529-539; Chousterman, B.G., Swirski, F.K., Weber, G.F., Cytokine storm and sepsis disease pathogenesis (2017) Semin Immunopathol, 39 (5), pp. 517-528; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Ruan, Q., Yang, K., Wang, W., Jiang, L., Song, J., Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China (2020) Intensive Care Med, 46 (5), pp. 846-848; Wu, C., Chen, X., Cai, Y., Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.0994, [published online ahead of print March 13, 2020]; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513; Wygrecka, M., Jablonska, E., Guenther, A., Preissner, K.T., Markart, P., Current view on alveolar coagulation and fibrinolysis in acute inflammatory and chronic interstitial lung diseases (2008) Thromb Haemostasis, 99 (3), pp. 494-501; Stinson, S.F., Ryan, D.P., Hertweck, S., Hardy, J.D., Hwang-Kow, S.Y., Loosli, C.G., Epithelial and surfactant changes in influenzal pulmonary lesions (1976) Arch Pathol Lab Med, 100 (3), pp. 147-153; Burkhardt, A., Alveolitis and collapse in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (1989) Am Rev Resp Dis, 140 (2), pp. 513-524; Dang, C.V., Bell, W.R., Kaiser, D., Wong, A., Disorganization of cultured vascular endothelial cell monolayers by fibrinogen fragment D (1985) Science, 227 (4693), pp. 1487-1490; Leavell, K.J., Peterson, M.W., Gross, T.J., The role of fibrin degradation products in neutrophil recruitment to the lung (1996) Am J Resp Cell Mol Biol, 14 (1), pp. 53-60; Idell, S., James, K.K., Levin, E.G., Local abnormalities in coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways predispose to alveolar fibrin deposition in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (1989) J Clin Invest, 84 (2), pp. 695-705; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1033-1034; Sarzi-Puttini, P., Giorgi, V., Sirotti, S., COVID-19, cytokines and immunosuppression: what can we learn from severe acute respiratory syndrome?

Most of the patients suffered of a respiratory disease that will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severely ill patients, develop a systemic inflammatory response with a Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), that is characterized by a sudden increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alfa by activated macrophages (M1 phenotype). Blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab and using respirator equipment seems to be a very important issue in this (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, but not all patients are referred to such treatments. Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype). Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals. This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries. © 2020","COVID-19 pneumonia; Low dose radiotherapy; Lung","interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer risk; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; cytokine release; cytokine release syndrome; cytokine storm; human; intensive care unit; ionizing radiation; low energy radiation; macrophage; nonhuman; priority journal; radiation induced neoplasm; virus pneumonia",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1033-1034; Channappanavar, R., Perlman, S.N., Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology (2017) Semin Immunopathol, 39, pp. 529-539; Norelli, M., Camisa, B., Barbiera, G., Monocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-6 are differentially required for cytokine-release syndrome and neurotoxicity due to CAR T cells (2018) Nat Med, 24 (6), pp. 739-748; Crayne, C.B., Albeituni, S., Nichols, K.E., Cron R.Q The immunology of macrophage activation syndrome (2019) Front Immunol, 10, p. 119; Murray, P.J., Wynn, T.A., Protective and pathogenic functions of macrophage subsets (2011) Nat Rev Immunol, 11, pp. 723-737; Fukui, S., Iwamoto, N., Takatani, A., M1 and M2 monocytes in rheumatoid arthritis: a contribution of imbalance ofM1/M2 monocytes to osteoclastogenesis (1958) Front Immunol, 2018, p. 8; McGonagle, D., Sharif, K., O'Regan, A., Bridgewood, C., Interleukin-6 use in COVID-19 pneumonia related macrophage activation syndrome (2020) Autoimmun Rev, 3; Jones, S.A., Jenkins, B.J., Recent insights into targeting the IL-6 cytokine family in inflammatory diseases and cancer (2018) Nat Rev Immunol, 18 (12), pp. 773-789; Navarro, G., Taroumian, S., Barroso, N., Tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis of efficacy and selected clinical conundrums (2014) Sem Arthr Rheum, 4 (4), pp. 458-469; Le, R.Q., Li, L., Yuan, W., FDA approval summary: tocilizumab for treatment of chimeric antigen receptor t cell-induced severe or life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (2018) Oncologist, 23 (8), pp. 943-947; Ott, O.J., Niewald, M., Weitmann, H.D., DEGRO guidelines for the radiotherapy of non-malignant disorders.

There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

Previous evidence suggests that RAS may represent an important target for the treatment of lung pathologies, especially for acute respiratory distress syndrome and chronic fibrotic disease. The scientific community has recently focused its attention on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) inhibitors and their possible benefit/harms for patients infected by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who experience pneumonia, but there are still some doubts about the effects of these drugs in this setting. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, there is still no licensed specific antiviral treatment for the human coronavirus disease and a vaccine will not be ready soon. However, based on experience from the use of other antiviral agents to treat similar virusses, some treatment options have been tried with some efficacy. Clinical trials for future therapies are still ongoing. In the meantime, prevention, control, active communication and investment in research are the only ways to overcome this challenge. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Antiviral treatment; Coronavirus; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","arbidol; azithromycin; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir; ritonavir; tocilizumab; antivirus agent; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; drug approval; drug safety; extracorporeal oxygenation; high risk patient; human; immune system; infection control; infection prevention; medical research; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antiviral Agents",,,,,,"(2020), https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases.Accessed17, Apr; Malta, M., Rimoin, A.W., Strathdee, S.A., The coronavirus 2019-nCoV epidemic: Is hindsight 20/20?

Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR 5–12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI) 0.55 (0.37–0.82) p = 0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90%, and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.54 (0.36–0.82) p = 0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR 0.42 (0.26–0.66) p < 0.001. The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required. © 2020, The Author(s).","Coronavirus infections; Covid-19; Heparin; Mortality; Pulmonary embolism; Thrombosis",,,,,,"National Institute for Health Research, NIHR

Indeed, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 promotes a dysfunctional immune response that dysregulates the cytokine secretory pattern. Hypercytokinemia underlies the hyperinflammatory state leading to injury of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, as well as to lung infiltration sustained by neutrophils and macrophages. Within such a pathogenic context, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines/chemokines play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role. Therefore, cytokines and their receptors, as well as cytokine-dependent intracellular signalling pathways can be targeted by potential therapies aimed to relieve the heavy burden of cytokine storm. In particular, the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is emerging as one of the most promising pharmacologic treatments.

In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Cov-2 virus a global pandemic. We performed a narrative review to describe existing literature with regard to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and future perspective. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched for relevant articles. Although only when the pandemic ends it will be possible to assess the full health, social and economic impact of this global disaster, this review represents a picture of the current state of the art. In particular, we focus on public health impact, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, diagnosis, case management, emergency response and preparedness. © 2020 by the authors.

As of May 7, 2020, there were 3 672 238 confirmed infections and 254 045 deaths attributed to COVID-19. Evidence has shown that there are asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 who can transmit the disease to others. The virus incubation time shows a wide range (0–24 days) and the virus displays a high infectivity. It is therefore urgent to develop an effective therapy to treat patients with COVID-19 and to control the spread of the causative agent, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Repurposing of approved drugs is widely adopted to fight newly emerged diseases such as COVID-19, as these drugs have known pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. As pathological examination has confirmed the involvement of immune hyperactivation and acute respiratory distress syndrome in fatal cases of COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab, have been proposed as potential therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. In this Review, we discuss the immunological aspects of COVID-19 and the potential implication of DMARDs in treating this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,"2019CR206

Given the paucity of proven data in treating COVID-19, management of these patients is difficult, rapidly evolving, and mainly based on anecdotal experience. We report 2 cases of heart transplant (HT) recipients with COVID-19. The first is a 59-year-old female with HT in 2012 who presented on March 20, 2020 with fever, hypoxia, and ground-glass opacities on chest X-ray. She quickly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock. Despite reduction in immunosuppression and treatment with tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she ultimately died from multiorgan failure. The second case is a 75-year-old man with HT in 2000 who presented on April 2, 2020 after curbside testing revealed positive COVID-19. Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started. Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated. The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home. These 2 cases highlight the wide range of different presentations of COVID-19 in HT recipients and the rapidity with which the management of these patients is evolving. © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","clinical research/practice;

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a cytokine storm, also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of corticosteroids, commonly utilized antiinflammatory agents, to treat COVID-19-induced CRS is controversial. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to treat COVID-19-induced CRS. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-induced CRS, compare the CRS in COVID-19 with that in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and summarize the existing therapies for CRS. We propose to utilize interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockade to manage COVID-19-induced CRS and discuss several factors that should be taken into consideration for its clinical application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coronavirus disease 2019; Cytokine release syndrome; Interleukin-6; Tocilizumab","antiinflammatory agent; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; drug effect; human; immunomodulation; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Humans; Immunomodulation; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; IL6 protein, human; Interleukin-6; tocilizumab",,,"European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes, EFSD

This was a retrospective review of patients with laboratory-confirmed severe COVID-19 who received tocilizumab and completed 14 days of follow up. Twenty-five patients were included, median age was 58 years (interquartile range, 50-63) and the majority were males (92%). Co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (48%), chronic kidney disease (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%). Fever (92%), cough (84%), and dyspnea (72%) were the commonest presenting symptoms. All patients received at least two concomitant investigational antiviral agents. Median oral temperature was on day 1, 3, and 7 was 38.0°C, 37.3°C (P =.043), and 37.0°C (P =.064), respectively. Corresponding median C-reactive protein was 193 and 7.9 mg/L (P <.0001) and <6 mg/L (P =.0001). Radiological improvement was noted in 44% of patients by day 7% and 68% by day 14. Nine patients (36%) were discharged alive from intensive care unit and three (12%) died. The proportion of patients on invasive ventilation declined from (84%) at the time of tocilizumab initiation to 60% on day 7 (P =.031) and 28% on day 14 (P =.001). The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event. However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy. In patients with severe COVID-19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements. Given the study's limitations, the results require assessment in adequately powered randomized controlled trials. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronavirus; COVID-19; IL-6; SARS-CoV-2; tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017; Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., The species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Nat Microbiol, 5 (4), pp. 536-544. , https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z; (2020) Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf, Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; (2020) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report 51 (11 March 2020), , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ba62e57_10, Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; (2020) Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) Situation Report 88 (17 April 2020), , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200417-sitrep-88-covid-191b6cccd94f8b4f219377bff55719a6ed.pdf?sfvrsn=ebe78315_6, Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; (2020) Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report 41 (1 March 2020), , https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200301-sitrep-41-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6768306d_2, Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), , https://www.moph.gov.qa/english/Pages/Coronavirus2019.aspx, Doha, Qatar Ministry of Public Health; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention (2020) JAMA, 323, p. 1239. , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.2648; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5; Shim, E., Tariq, A., Choi, W., Lee, Y., Chowell, G., Transmission potential and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea (2020) Int J Infect Dis, 93, pp. 339-344. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.03.031; Onder, G., Rezza, G., Brusaferro, S., Case-fatality rate and characteristics of patients dying in relation to COVID-19 in Italy (2020) JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4683; Information for clinicians on therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients: Centers for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention (2020) Centers for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, , https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html; Tian, S., Hu, W., Niu, L., Liu, H., Xu, H., Xiao, S.-Y., Pulmonary pathology of early-phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer (2020) J Thorac Oncol, 15, pp. 700-704. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.02.010; Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Resp Med, 8 (4), pp. 420-422. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-600(20)30076-X; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1033-1034. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30628-0; (2017) ACTEMRA (Tocilizumab) Injection, for Intravenous or Subcutaneous Use, , https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/125276s114lbl.pdf, US Food and Drug Administration; Fu, B., Xu, X., Wei, H., Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?

Typical manifestations consist of flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. However, in about 20% of patients, the infection progresses to severe interstitial pneumonia and can induce an uncontrolled host-immune response, leading to a life-threatening condition called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS represents an emergency scenario of a frequent challenge, which is the complex and interwoven link between infections and autoimmunity. Indeed, treatment of CRS involves the use of both antivirals to control the underlying infection and immunosuppressive agents to dampen the aberrant pro-inflammatory response of the host. Several trials, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of immunosuppressants commonly used in rheumatic diseases, are ongoing in patients with COVID-19 and CRS, some of which are achieving promising results. However, such a use should follow a multidisciplinary approach, be accompanied by close monitoring, be tailored to patient’s clinical and serological features, and be initiated at the right time to reach the best results. Autoimmune patients receiving immunosuppressants could be prone to SARS-CoV-2 infections; however, suspension of the ongoing therapy is contraindicated to avoid disease flares and a consequent increase in the infection risk. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper provides a critical review of the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience with COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits, which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hubei Province and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and nonessential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of “Fangcang” shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin, and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. Although some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers, and contacts and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organised, proactive, and unified strategy at a national level. Delays result in significantly higher death tolls. © 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society",,"antivirus agent; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interferon; tocilizumab; antiviral therapy; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation; China; Chinese medicine; controlled clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; epidemic; experience; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart disease; hospital building; oxygen therapy; palliative therapy; pandemic; plasma transfusion; program effectiveness; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation",,"hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CAMS: 2016-I2M-1-003

First, those with COVID-19 and pre-existing cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become hosts or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and pre-print reports pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation","cardiovascular therapy; coronavirus; health system","alpha interferon; anakinra; antiarrhythmic agent; antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; beta interferon; bevacizumab; calcium channel blocking agent; chloroquine; colchicine; eculizumab; evolocumab; fingolimod; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; methylprednisolone; pirfenidone; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; steroid; tocilizumab; tranexamic acid; unindexed drug; warfarin; acute coronary syndrome; artery thrombosis; atrioventricular block; bradycardia; cardiac graft rejection; cardiogenic shock; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; disease severity; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug potentiation; electrolyte disturbance; emergency health service; health care personnel; health care system; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart bundle branch block; heart failure; heart infarction; heart muscle injury; heart transplantation; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; hemolytic anemia; human; hypertension; hypotension; medical education; medical ethics; medical information; mortality; myocardial disease; myocarditis; nonhuman; pandemic; pathophysiology; peripheral edema; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; QT prolongation; retina artery occlusion; retina vein occlusion; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; side effect; tachycardia; thromboembolism; torsade des pointes; unspecified side effect; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; virus transmission; vulnerable population; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; myocarditis; virology; virus pneumonia; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Heart Diseases; Humans; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Triage",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; bevacizumab, 216974-75-3, 1438851-35-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; evolocumab, 1256937-27-5; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; pirfenidone, 53179-13-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tranexamic acid, 1197-18-8, 701-54-2; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2",,,"Center for Social Inclusion, CSI

All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immune-based therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. Aim: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. Methods: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. Results: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. Conclusions: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"6 mercaptopurine derivative; adalimumab; atazanavir; azathioprine; beclometasone; beta interferon; budesonide; chloroquine; corticosteroid; favipiravir; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; influenza vaccine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; mercaptopurine; mesalazine; methotrexate; nitazoxanide; Pneumococcus vaccine; prednisolone; remdesivir; ribavirin; salazosulfapyridine; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor antibody; unindexed drug; ustekinumab; vedolizumab; abdominal pain; arthralgia; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; disease association; disease course; disease exacerbation; drug elimination; drug half life; dyspnea; hand washing; headache; human; infection prevention; infection risk; infection sensitivity; inflammatory bowel disease; influenza; interstitial pneumonia; isolation; malaise; medical decision making; medication compliance; myalgia; nucleic acid analysis; nutritional status; pandemic; patient care; patient compliance; pneumococcal infection; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smoking cessation; social distance; systematic review; telemedicine; throat culture; unspecified side effect; virus transmission; vomiting",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; atazanavir, 198904-31-3; azathioprine, 446-86-6; beclometasone, 4419-39-0; budesonide, 51333-22-3, 51372-29-3; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; golimumab, 476181-74-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; infliximab, 170277-31-3; mercaptopurine, 31441-78-8, 50-44-2, 6112-76-1; mesalazine, 89-57-6; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; nitazoxanide, 55981-09-4; prednisolone, 50-24-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; salazosulfapyridine, 599-79-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tofacitinib, 477600-75-2, 540737-29-9; tumor necrosis factor antibody, 162774-06-3; ustekinumab, 815610-63-0, 949907-93-1; vedolizumab, 943609-66-3","gs 5734; kaletra",,"Gilead Sciences

Some coronaviruses cause only mild illnesses like the common cold. While, some coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have, in recent years, been able to cause severe respiratory involvement (pneumonia), leading to death in several patients. By identifying the genomic sequence of the new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) it has been revealed that it belongs to the beta coronavirus genus. COVID-19 appears to be transmitted by a mechanism similar to the influenza virus via person to person, sneezing coughing, or contact with the secretions of infected patients. Early symptoms of these respiratory viruses include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with an incubation period of 2-14 days. SARS-CoV-2 is an acute respiratory disease that initially causes lung damage. SARS-CoV-2 can affect other organs, including the kidneys. Kidney damage may be caused by alterations that occur during coronavirus infection. It seems that low-oxygen delivery to tissues like the kidney in the setting of this disease may lead to ischemic damage of the kidney. Considering the importance of the kidneys, as one, this review study aimed to investigate the effect of the new coronavirus on the kidneys and its role in the development of renal failure. © 2020 The Author(s);

Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; receptor; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; human; myocarditis; nonhuman; pericarditis; pharmaceutical care; plasma; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Coronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (2020), https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, (Accessed 1 April 2020); Shi, S., Qin, M., Shen, B., Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan (2020), China JAMA Cardiology; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia in Wuhan (2020) China JAMA, 323 (11), pp. 1061-1069; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections—more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/sars/surveillance/absence.html, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO.A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020 when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020.During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at 9 different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died prior to or shortly after decannulation, and 5 are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these 5 discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: 4 of 5 survivors received intravenous steroids, 3 of 5 survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), 2 of 5 survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and 1 of 5 survivors received hydroxychloroquine.An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS. These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients, and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,1538943X,,,"32317557","English","ASAIO J.",Article,"Article in Press",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084616606

To understand the impact on transplant activity across the US, and center-level variation in testing, clinical practice, and policies, we conducted a national survey between March 24-31, 2020 and linked responses to the COVID-19 incidence map. Response rate was a very high 79.3%, reflecting a strong national priority to better understand COVID-19. Complete suspension of live donor kidney transplantation was reported by 71.8% and live donor liver by 67.7%. While complete suspension of deceased donor transplantation was less frequent, some restrictions to deceased donor kidney transplantation were reported by 84.0% and deceased donor liver by 73.3%; more stringent restrictions were associated with higher regional incidence of COVID-19. Shortage of COVID-19 tests was reported by 42.5%. Respondents reported a total of 148 COVID-19 recipients from <1y to >10y post-transplant: 69.6% were kidney recipients, and 25.0% were critically ill. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was used by 78.1% of respondents; azithromycin by 46.9%; tocilizumab by 31.3%, and remdesivir by 25.0%. There is wide heterogeneity in center-level response across the US; ongoing national data collection, expert discussion, and clinical studies are critical to informing evidence-based practices.

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"C reactive protein; chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; gamma interferon; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; steroid; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; aging; Article; artificial ventilation; cardiovascular disease; congenital heart disease; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease association; disease burden; disease transmission; extracorporeal oxygenation; hand washing; heart muscle injury; human; infection prevention; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; pandemic; pathophysiology; pediatrics; pregnant woman; priority journal; SARS-related coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; symptomatology; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; complication; Coronavirus infection; disease management; heart; heart disease; virology; virus pneumonia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Ksiazek, T.G., Erdman, D., Goldsmith, C.S., A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to demonstrate the association of elevated IL-6 with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A total of 9 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher serum IL-6 levels compared to non-severe patients (mean difference (MD): 38.6 pg/mL, 95% CI: 24.3 – 52.9 pg/mL, p <0.001, I2 = 98.5%). On meta-regression, increasing mean IL-6 level was associated with increased mortality in patients (Coefficient (Q): 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01-0.03, p = 0.03). Given the association of elevated IL-6 with severe COVID-19 and mortality, clinicians should use this as a potential marker to recognize severe disease. IL-6 should be incorporated in a scoring system along with other inflammatory markers to risk stratify the patients for early recognition of severe disease. Our study should encourage researchers to conduct trial evaluating Anti IL-6 antibodies such as Tocilizumab to assess the efficacy in patients with severe COVID-19.

This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6 %) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33–47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1 %) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50–72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7 % (95 % CI 14.6–24.9 %) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 % CI 1.48−2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.42−6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 % CI 1.41−48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95 % CI 1.02−1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 % CI 1.37−4.87) upon admission. Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 %.

In preliminary reports it was suggested to be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: In this open-label prospective study we describe clinical characteristics and outcome of 51 patients hospitalized with confirmed and severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab intravenously. All patients had elevated IL-6 plasma level (>40 pg/mL) and oxygen saturation <93% in ambient air. Clinical outcomes, oxygen support, laboratory data and adverse events were collected over a follow-up of 30 days. Results: Forty-five patients (88%) were on high-flow oxygen supplementation, six of whom with invasive ventilation. From baseline to day 7 after tocilizumab we observed a dramatic drop of body temperature and CRP value with a significant increase in lymphocyte count (p<0.001). Over a median follow-up time of 34 days from tocilizumab, 34 patients (67%) showed an improvement in their clinical severity class; 31 were discharged; 17 (33%) showed a worsening of their clinical status, of these 14 died (27%). The mortality rate was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation at baseline (83.3% vs 20% of patients on non-invasive oxygen support; p=0.0001). The most frequent side effects were an increase of hepatic enzymes (29%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and serious bacterial and fungal infections (27%). Conclusion: Tocilizumab exerts a rapidly beneficial effect on fever and inflammatory markers, although no significant impact on the clinical outcome can be inferred by our results. Critically ill patients seem to have a high risk of serious infections with this drug. © 2020 European Federation of Internal Medicine","COVID-19; IL-6 inhibitors; tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Zhao, X., Research Team, A novel coronavirus from patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Wang, W., Tan, W., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 565-574; https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource. In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza. These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s).","2019-nCoV; Adjunctive intervention; Antiviral therapy; Coronavirus; Respiratory support","arbidol; chloroquine; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interferon; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oxygen; remdesivir; ribavirin; thymosin alpha1; tocilizumab; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; artificial ventilation; assisted circulation; assisted ventilation; Chinese medicine; clinical classification; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; critically ill patient; extracorporeal oxygenation; fluid therapy; human; intensive care unit; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; nutrition; oxygen therapy; plasma transfusion; priority journal; prone position; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus identification",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; thymosin alpha1, 69521-94-4; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (8), pp. 727-733. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXjslGmsrc%3D, PID: 31978945; Clinical-Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection When Novel Coronavirus (2019-Ncov) Infection is Suspected-Interim Guidance, , Published January 28, 2020; Qiu, H., Tong, Z., Ma, P., Intensive care during the coronavirus epidemic (2020) Intensive Care Med; Hui, D.S., Azhar, I., Madani, T.A., The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health—the latest, novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China (2019) Int J Infect Dis., 2020 (91), pp. 264-266; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395 (10224), pp. 565-574. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhvFOmsLY%3D, PID: 32007145; Yu, Y.X., Sun, L., Yao, K., Consideration and prevention for the aerosol transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus (2020) Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi., 56, p.

The available evidence has not allowed guidelines to clearly recommend any drugs outside the context of clinical trials. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 invokes a hyperinflammatory state driven by multiple cells and mediators like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), etc. Considering the proven role of cytokine dysregulation in causing this hyperinflammation in the lungs with IL-6 being a key driver, particularly in seriously ill COVID-19 patients, it is crucial to further explore selective cytokine blockade with drugs like the IL-6 inhibitors tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab. These targeted monoclonal antibodies can dampen the downstream IL-6 signaling pathways, which can lead to decreased cell proliferation, differentiation, oxidative stress, exudation, and improve clinical outcomes in patients with evident features of cytokine-driven inflammation like persistent fever, dyspnea and elevated markers. Preliminary evidence has come for tocilizumab from some small studies, and interim analysis of a randomized controlled trial; the latter also being available for sarilumab. International guidelines do include IL-6 inhibitors as one of the options available for severe or critically ill patients. There has been increased interest in evaluating these drugs with a series of clinical trials being registered and conducted in different countries. The level of investigation though perhaps needs to be further intensified as there is a need to focus on therapeutic options that can prove to be ‘life-saving’ as the number of COVID-19 fatalities worldwide keeps increasing alarmingly. IL-6 inhibitors could be one such treatment option, with generation of more evidence and completion of a larger number of systematic studies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, Johns Hopkins University (JHU).

Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection. Observations: No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, but it is not US Food and Drug Administration approved and currently is being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Current clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective to date. © 2020 American Medical Association.

It caused a total of 80 868 confirmed cases and 3101 deaths in Chinese mainland until March 8, 2020. This novel virus spread mainly through respiratory droplets and close contact. As disease progressed, a series of complications tend to develop, especially in critically ill patients. Pathological findings showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome and involvement of multiple organs. Apart from supportive care, no specific treatment has been established for COVID-19. The efficacy of some promising antivirals, convalescent plasma transfusion, and tocilizumab needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials. © 2020, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","clinical characteristics; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; pathology; radiology; treatment","antivirus agent; animal; Betacoronavirus; cerebrovascular accident; complication; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; human; pandemic; passive immunization; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stroke; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,"Antiviral Agents",,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72 314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) JAMA; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Ren, R.L.K.L.E., Feng, Z., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med; Wu, J.T., Leung, K., Leung, G.M., Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10225), pp. 689-697. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXktFCns7k%3D, PID: 32014114; Wang, H., Wang, Z., Dong, Y., Chang, R., Xu, C., Yu, X., Zhang, S., Cai, Y., Phase-adjusted estimation of the number of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in Wuhan, China (2020) Cell Discov, 6 (1), p. 10. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXktlGhtrk%3D, PID: 32133152; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 507-513. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhvFOmsb8%3D, PID: 32007143; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., To, K.K., Chu, H., Yang, J., Xing, F., Yuen, K.Y., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 514-523. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Ojsro%3D, PID: 31986261; Huang, R., Xia, J., Chen, Y., Shan, C., Wu, C., A family cluster of SARSCoV-2 infection involving 11 patients in Nanjing, China (2020) Lancet Infect Dis; Phelan, A.L., Katz, R., Gostin, L.O., The novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China: challenges for global health governance (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), p. 709; Zhang, W., Du, R.H., Li, B., Zheng, X.S., Yang, X.L., Hu, B., Wang, Y.Y., Zhou, P., Molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCoV infected patients: implication of multiple shedding routes (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9 (1), pp. 386-389. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXmsVGltbk%3D, PID: 32065057; Ong, S.W.X., Tan, Y.K., Chia, P.Y., Lee, T.H., Ng, O.T., Wong, M.S.Y., Marimuthu, K., Air, surface environmental, and personal protective equipment contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a symptomatic patient (2020) JAMA; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., Zhao, X., Tan, W., China Novel Coronavirus Investigating and Research Team.

Pascale' Napels, Italy","The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has placed an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems around the world. In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as a € cytokine storm'. One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Initial experience from the outbreaks in Italy, China and the USA has anecdotally demonstrated improved outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 with the administration of cytokine-modulatory therapies, especially anti-IL-6 agents. Although ongoing trials are investigating anti-IL-6 therapies, access to these therapies is a concern, especially as the numbers of cases worldwide continue to climb. An immunology-informed approach may help identify alternative agents to modulate the pathological inflammation seen in patients with COVID-19. Drawing on extensive experience administering these and other immune-modulating therapies, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer offers this perspective on potential alternatives to anti-IL-6 that may also warrant consideration for management of the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary compromise that can be seen in patients with severe COVID-19. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Distrust in governmental institutions shaped the critical phase of early response. Having a weak public health infrastructure and a lack of public trust, the Ministry of Health (MoH) began the fight against COVID-19 with a losing streak. Within 45 days of the first reported case, the political crisis and turmoil caused by “fake news” are limiting the capacity and success of the MoH response to the pandemic.

This area has faced numerous challenges, including the  shortage of frequent-use products (hydroalcoholic solutions, lopinavir/ritonavir  suspension), the use of new preparations for SARS-CoV-2 (tocilizumab,  remdesivir), or requests from overwhelmed wards unable to assume the safe  preparation of a high volume of medications (intravenous solutions). The  demand for all types of preparations (topic and oral medications, intravenous  solutions) has increased dramatically. This increase has highlighted the shortage of resources allocated to this area, which has made it difficult to meet the high  demand for preparations. In addition, the pandemic has revealed the scarcity of  research on such basic aspects as agent stability and drug compatibility. One of  the most relevant conclusions drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic is that the  basic areas of hospital pharmacy, along with other, must be maintained and  reinforced, as these are the areas that make us essential.

El incremento de actividad ha sido en todo tipo de  preparados (tópicos, orales y mezclas intravenosas) y ha puesto de manifiesto la escasez de recursos destinados a esta área, que se ha traducido en serios  problemas para afrontar todas las elaboraciones necesarias, así como la falta de  investigación en aspectos tan básicos como la estabilidad o la compatibilidad de  medicamentos. Probablemente, una de las conclusiones más importantes que  podemos extraer tras la COVID-19 es que —sin menospreciar otras áreas de la  farmacia hospitalaria que también deben desarrollarse— debemos mantener y  potenciar las áreas básicas de nuestra profesión.

Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with severe disease. This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients (n = 6; age range 19–75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation, n = 5) with PaO2/FiO2 ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients (n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43–2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89–1029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26–0.82 × 103/µl) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23–1.02 × 103/µl). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients. This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19. While this initial experience is promising, efficacy will need to be further assessed in a randomized controlled trial. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cell therapy; Coronavirus; Cytokine storm; Hyperinflammation","corticosteroid;

Despite the immense and ongoing global effort, no efficacious drugs to fight this plague have been identified and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance. Several authors have reported that the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases comorbidities were indeed frequent among patients with COVID-19, which suggests that these conditions are likely to aggravate and complicate the prognosis. What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, D-dimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPARγ agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their anti-inflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antiinflammatory agent; cytokine; glucocorticoid; pioglitazone; tocilizumab; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cardiovascular risk; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; human; inflammation; insulin resistance; lung injury; neurologic disease; nonhuman; protein synthesis inhibition; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment duration",,"pioglitazone, 105355-27-9, 111025-46-8; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Li, H., Zhou, Y., Zhang, M., Wang, H., Zhao, Q., Liu, J., Updated approaches against SARS-CoV-2.

Various treatment strategies have been attempted. Methods and Results: A 61-year-old man with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and was confirmed positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction 58% (with ejection fraction 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously × 1 dose. Within 24 hours, he showed significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia that improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. Conclusion: Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical trials of clazakizumab for treatment of COVID-19 are underway worldwide. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,,,"Liu, T., Zhang, J., Yang, Y., The role of interleukin-6 in monitoring severe case of coronavirus disease 2019 (2020) EMBO Mol Med, , accessed June 15,2020; Toniati, P., Piva, S., Cattalini, M., Tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with hyperinflammatory syndrome and acute respiratory failure: a single center study of 100 patients in Brescia, Italy (2020) Autoimmun Rev, p. 102568; Nishimoto, N., Kishimoto, T., Yoshizaki, K., Anti-interleukin 6 receptor antibody treatment in rheumatic disease (2000) Ann Rheum Dis, 59, pp. i21-i27; Paquette, S.G., Banner, D., Zhao, Z., Interleukin-6 is a potential biomarker for severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection (2012) PLoS One, 7; Xu, X., Han, M., Li, T., Effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab (2020) ChinaXiv, 202003, p.

Therefore, based on the fast and global spread of the virus, urgent investigations are warranted in order to develop preventive and therapeutic drugs. In this regard, treatments addressing the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become a major focus. Notably, while a rapid and well-coordinated immune response represents the first line of defense against viral infection, excessive inflammatory innate response and impaired adaptive host immune defense may lead to tissue damage both at the site of virus entry and at systemic level. Several studies highlight relevant changes occurring both in innate and adaptive immune system in COVID-19 patients. In particular, the massive cytokine and chemokine release, the so-called “cytokine storm”, clearly reflects a widespread uncontrolled dysregulation of the host immune defense. Although the prospective of counteracting cytokine storm is compelling, a major limitation relies on the limited understanding of the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identification of signaling pathways altered during viral infections may help to unravel the most relevant molecular cascades implicated in biological processes mediating viral infections and to unveil key molecular players that may be targeted. Thus, given the key role of the immune system in COVID-19, a deeper understanding of the mechanism behind the immune dysregulation might give us clues for the clinical management of the severe cases and for preventing the transition from mild to severe stages. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"adalimumab; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epidermal growth factor receptor; gamma interferon; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 23; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; myeloid differentiation factor 88; neutralizing antibody; nucleocapsid protein; pathogen associated molecular pattern; RANTES; ruxolitinib; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; tocilizumab; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 7; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; toll like receptor; adaptive immunity; antiinflammatory activity; Burkholderia pseudomallei; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release; cytokine storm; host pathogen interaction; human; immune dysregulation; immune response; immunopathology; innate immunity; JAK-STAT signaling; lung injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; Ruminococcus; seroconversion; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tissue injury; ubiquitination; virology; virus entry; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; intestine flora; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; virus pneumonia; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Disease Progression; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; T-Lymphocytes; Toll-Like Receptors",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; epidermal growth factor receptor, 79079-06-4; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; interleukin 12, 138415-13-1; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, 155075-84-6; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; toll like receptor, 409141-78-2; toll like receptor 4, 203811-83-0; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme, 151769-16-3; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Antiviral Agents; Cytokines; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; Toll-Like Receptors",,,"UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Pavia","We thank all the doctors, nurses, public health workers, and researchers for the braveness in fighting against SARS-CoV-2 and the efforts to save the life of COVID-19 patients.

However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing. Main Body: Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative. Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use. This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II-III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use. Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy. Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the ""viral program"". Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication. Short Conclusion: To our knowledge, cancer drugs potentially suitable for facing SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been carefully reviewed. We present here a comprehensive analysis of available information on potential candidate cancer drugs that can be repurposed for the treatment of COIVD-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","Anticancer drugs; BCG; Drug repurposing; Health emergencies; Immune response; Viral pneumonia","anakinra; antineoplastic agent; BCG vaccine; chloroquine; dactinomycin; emapalumab; enzyme inhibitor; everolimus; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monalizumab; rapamycin; rapamycin derivative; remdesivir; ribavirin; ridaforolimus; sarilumab; si 113; temsirolimus; tocilizumab; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; compassionate use; coronavirus disease 2019; drug repositioning; drug screening; energy metabolism; human; lipogenesis; nonhuman; nucleic acid synthesis; priority journal; protein synthesis; Review; signal transduction; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; immunomodulation; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Immunomodulation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; dactinomycin, 1402-38-6, 1402-58-0, 50-76-0; emapalumab, 1709815-23-5; everolimus, 159351-69-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; monalizumab, 1228763-95-8; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; ridaforolimus, 572924-54-0; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; temsirolimus, 162635-04-3, 343261-52-9; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents","si 113",,,,,"Ashburn, T.T., Thor, K.B., Drug repositioning: Identifying and developing new uses for existing drugs (2004) Nat Rev Drug Discov, 3 (8), pp. 673-683. , 10.1038/nrd1468 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2cXmtVOhtL8%3D; Abbruzzese, C., Matteoni, S., Signore, M., Cardone, L., Nath, K., Glickson, J.D., Drug repurposing for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (2017) J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 36 (1), p. 169. , 10.1186/s13046-017-0642-x 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC1cXitFWntrfN 29179732 5704391; Abbruzzese, C., Matteoni, S., Persico, M., Villani, V., Paggi, M.G., Repurposing chlorpromazine in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: Analysis of literature and forthcoming steps (2020) J Exp Clin Cancer Res, 39 (1), p. 26. , 10.1186/s13046-020-1534-z 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXltFelsb8%3D 32005270 6995164; Elfiky, A.A., Anti-HCV, nucleotide inhibitors, repurposing against COVID-19 (2020) Life Sci, 248, p. 117477. , 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117477 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXksFeisLo%3D 32119961 7089605; Zhou, Y., Hou, Y., Shen, J., Huang, Y., Martin, W., Cheng, F., Network-based drug repurposing for novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Cell Discov, 6, p. 14. , 10.1038/s41421-020-0153-3 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXkvFCnt78%3D 32194980 7073332; Baron, S.A., Devaux, C., Colson, P., Raoult, D., Rolain, J.M., Teicoplanin: An alternative drug for the treatment of coronavirus COVID-19?

Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies. Here, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the immune system and the subsequent contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression. From nascent reports describing SARS-CoV-2, we make inferences on the basis of the parallel pathophysiological and immunological features of the other human coronaviruses targeting the lower respiratory tract — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Finally, we highlight the implications of these approaches for potential therapeutic interventions that target viral infection and/or immunoregulation. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; baricitinib; bevacizumab; bromhexine; chloroquine; danoprevir; dantonic; eculizumab; favipiravir; fingolimod; fungal extract; ganovo; gimsilumab; huaier; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; methylprednisolone; recombinant alpha2b interferon; recombinant human angiotensin converting enzyme 2; recombinant protein; remdesivir; ritonavir; ruxolitinib; Salvia miltiorrhiza extract; sarilumab; thalidomide; tocilizumab; umifenovir; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; xue bi jing; adjuvant therapy; cellular immunity; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; human; humoral immunity; immune response; immunity; immunopathogenesis; inflammation; Lonicera; medical care; mesenchymal stem cell; nonhuman; pathogenesis; plasma transfusion; priority journal; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus cell interaction; virus entry; virus replication; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; immunology; inflammation; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Inflammation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; bevacizumab, 216974-75-3, 1438851-35-4; bromhexine, 3572-43-8, 611-75-6; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; danoprevir, 916881-67-9, 1001913-18-3, 1225266-12-5, 850876-88-9, 916826-48-7; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; gimsilumab, 1648796-29-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; recombinant alpha2b interferon, 98530-12-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; thalidomide, 50-35-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; umifenovir, 131707-25-0","avastin; ganovo; soliris",,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research, A*STAR","The authors thank Insight Editing London for its inputs on an early draft.

Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"antibiotic agent; chloroquine; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; tocilizumab; acute respiratory failure; artificial ventilation; bacterial pneumonia; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; decontamination; diarrhea; drug repositioning; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; emergency health service; extracorporeal oxygenation; fluid therapy; health care personnel; heart arrest; human; hypotension; hypovolemia; infection prevention; intensive care; intensive care unit; loading drug dose; medical research; mortality; nausea; pandemic; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; vomiting",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Morens, D.M., Daszak, P., Taubenberger, J.K., Escaping Pandora's box—another novel coronavirus (2020) N Engl J Med, , published online Feb 26; COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic (2020), https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/, (Accessed 2 April 2020); Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003 (2003), https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/, (Accessed 7 March 2020); Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2019), https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/, (Accessed 7 March 2020); Xie, J., Tong, Z., Guan, X., Du, B., Qiu, H., Slutsky, A.S., Critical care crisis and some recommendations during the COVID-19 epidemic in China (2020) Intensive Care Med, , published online March 2; Qiu, H., Tong, Z., Ma, P., Intensive care during the coronavirus epidemic (2020) Intensive Care Med, 46, pp. 576-578; Baud, D., Qi, X., Nielsen-Saines, K., Musso, D., Pomar, L., Favre, G., Real estimates of mortality following COVID-19 infection (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, , published online March 12; Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf, (Accessed 7 March 2020); Grasselli, G., Pesenti, A., Cecconi, M., Critical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: early experience and forecast during an emergency response (2020) JAMA, , published online March 13; Remuzzi, A., Remuzzi, G., COVID-19 and Italy: what next?

This review highlights the preventive measures, available clinical therapies and the potential of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 by taking into consideration the strong genetic similarities of the 2003 epidemic SARS-CoV. Recent studies are investigating the repurposing of US FDA-approved drugs as there is no available vaccine yet with many attempts under clinical evaluation. Several antivirals, antimalarials and immunomodulators that have shown activity against SARS-CoV and Middle East coronavirus respiratory syndromes are being evaluated. In particular, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, arbidol, tocilizumab and bevacizumab have shown promising results. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of this pandemic and where we currently stand. © 2020 © 2020 Newlands Press.","COVID-19; infection; repurposed therapies; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine; viruses","antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus RNA; virus vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; genetics; human; immunology; laboratory technique; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Viral Vaccines",,"Antiviral Agents; COVID-19 vaccine; RNA, Viral; Viral Vaccines",,,,,,"Jeevanandam, J., Pal, K., Danquah, M.K., Virus-like nanoparticles as a novel delivery tool in gene therapy (2019) Biochimie, 157, pp. 38-47; Aljabali, A.A., Sainsbury, F., Lomonossoff, G.P., Evans, D.J., Cowpea mosaic virus unmodified empty virus-like particles loaded with metal and metal oxide (2010) Small, 6 (7), pp. 818-821; Cascella, M., Rajnik, M., Cuomo, A., Dulebohn, S.C., Di Napoli, R., (2020) Features, Evaluation and Treatment Coronavirus (COVID-19, , StatPearls, Treasure Island (FL); Chen, W.H., Strych, U., Hotez, P.J., Bottazzi, M.E., The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pipeline: An overview (2020) Curr Trop Med Rep, pp. 1-4; Ferretti, L., Wymant, C., Kendall, M., Quantifying SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests epidemic control with digital contact tracing (2020) Science; Wrapp, D., Wang, N., Corbett, K.S., Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation (2020) Science, 367 (6483), pp. 1260-1263; Woo, P.C., Huang, Y., Lau, S.K., Yuen, K.-Y., Coronavirus genomics and bioinformatics analysis (2010) Vruses, 2 (8), pp. 1804-1820; Drexler, J.F., Gloza-Rausch, F., Glende, J., Genomic characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in European bats and classification of coronaviruses based on partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene sequences (2010) J.

We herein report our initial experience with solid organ transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two centers during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak in New York City. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, antiviral and immunosuppressive management were compared between patients with mild/moderate and severe disease (defined as ICU admission, intubation or death). Ninety patients were analyzed with a median age of 57 years. Forty-six were kidney recipients, 17 lung, 13 liver, 9 heart, and 5 dual-organ transplants. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (70%), cough (59%), and dyspnea (43%). Twenty-two (24%) had mild, 41 (46%) moderate, and 27 (30%) severe disease. Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non-rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID-19 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild/asymptomatic cases. As this outbreak unfolds, COVID-19 has the potential to severely impact solid organ transplant recipients. © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","antibiotic: antiviral; clinical research/practice; complication: infectious; immunosuppression/immune modulation; infection and infectious agents – viral; infectious disease; organ transplantation in general",,,,,,,,,"Holshue, M.L., DeBolt, C., Lindquist, S., First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (10), pp. 929-936; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Porcheddu, R., Serra, C., Kelvin, D., Similarity in case fatality rates (CFR) of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 in Italy and China (2020) J Infect Dev Ctries, 14 (2), pp. 125-128; Arentz, M., Yim, E., Klaff, L., Characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4326, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) JAMA, 323 (13), p. 1239; Onder, G., Rezza, G., Brusaferro, S., Case-fatality rate and characteristics of patients dying in relation to COVID-19 in Italy JAMA, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.4683, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Michaels, M.G., La Hoz, R.M., Danziger-Isakov, L., Coronavirus disease 2019: implications of emerging infections for transplantation Am J Transplant, , https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15832, [published online ahead of print 2020]; Guillen, E., Pineiro, G.J., Revuelta, I., Case report of COVID-19 in a kidney transplant recipient: does immunosuppression alter the clinical presentation?

Recent studies have found that ⁓ 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression. Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes. IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm. Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials. In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)” in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"tocilizumab;

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2. While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients. The present review summarizes the evidence on ECMO management of severe ARDS in light of recent COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time focusing on differences and similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO in terms of hematological and inflammatory interplay when these two settings merge. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"interleukin 11; interleukin 3; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; interleukin 9; thrombopoietin; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; cardiogenic shock; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; inflammation; lymphocytopenia; mortality; narrative; pandemic; platelet count; priority journal; respiratory failure; Review; seasonal influenza; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; thrombocytopenia; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Blood Coagulation; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Thrombocytopenia",,"interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; thrombopoietin, 9014-42-0; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en, Accessed 3 Apr 2020; Zhou, G., Chen, S., Chen, Z., Back to the spring of Wuhan: Facts and hope of covid-19 outbreak (2020) Front Med., , ahead of print; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Liu, L., Zhong, N.S., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for C.

To date, there is no effective treatment. Clinical management is largely symptomatic, with organ support in intensive care for critically ill patients. The first phase I trial to test the efficacy of a vaccine has recently begun, but in the meantime there is an urgent need to decrease the morbidity and mortality of severe cases. It is known that patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments. Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 could in some case induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with potentially fatal severe lung injury and patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome and viral ARDS result from uncontrolled severe acute inflammation. Acute lung injury results from inflammatory monocyte and macrophage activation in the pulmonary luminal epithelium which lead to a release of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cytokines play a crucial role in immune-related pneumonitis, and could represent a promising target when the infiltration is T cell predominant or there are indirect signs of high IL-6-related inflammation, such as elevated C-reactive protein. A monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab has been administered in a number of cases in China and Italy. Positive clinical and radiological outcomes have been reported. These early findings have led to an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial in China and Italy. While data from those trials are eagerly awaited, patients' management will continue to rely for the vast majority on local guidelines. Among many other aspects, this crisis has proven that different specialists must join forces to deliver the best possible care to patients. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Coagulopathy contributing to significant morbidity in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 has now been well documented. We discuss two cases selected from patients requiring critical care in April 2020 in New York City with a unique clinical course. Both cases reveal significant thrombotic events noted on imaging during their hospital course. Obtaining serial inflammatory markers in conjunction with anti-phospholipid antibody testing revealed clinically significant Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This case series reviews the details preceding APS observed in SARS-CoV-2 and aims to report findings that could potentially further our understanding of the disease. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anticardiolipin; Antiphospholipid syndrome; Coagulopathy; Coronarvirus; Covid-19; Critical care; ICU; Infarct; Peripheral arterial disease; SARS-CoV-2; Stroke","anakinra; azithromycin; cardiolipin antibody; D dimer; hemoglobin; heparin; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; lactate dehydrogenase; low molecular weight heparin; tocilizumab; abdominal pain; adult; anemia; Article; brain edema; brain infarction; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; cyanosis; disease course; disease severity; dyslipidemia; dyspnea; female; fever; human; intubation; laboratory test; lethargy; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; male; medical history; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occupational exposure; pallor; respiratory failure; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; splenomegaly; thorax radiography; vomiting",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Klok, F.A., Kruip, M.J.H.A., van der Meer, N.J.M., Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19 (2020) Thromb Res, , In press; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Tang, N., Li, D., Wang, X., Sun, Z., Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (2020) J Thromb Haemost, 18 (4), pp. 844-847; Lim, W., Antiphospholipid syndrome (2013) Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program, 2013, pp. 675-680; Zhang, Y., Xiao, M., Zhang, S., Coagulopathy and antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with Covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (17), p. 238; Asherson, R.A., Cervera, R., Antiphospholipid antibodies and infections (2003) Ann Rheum Dis, 62 (5), pp. 388-393; Warkentin, T.E., Aird, W.C., Rand, J.H., Platelet-endothelial interactions: sepsis, HIT, and antiphospholipid syndrome (2003) Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program, pp. 497-519; Harzallah, I., Debliquis, A., Drénou, B., Lupus anticoagulant is frequent in patients with Covid-19 (2020) J Thromb Haemost, , [published online ahead of print, 2020 Apr 23]","Shadi, M.; Department of Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital, NY - Northwell Health, United States; email: mshadi1@northwell.edu",,,"W.B.

The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Most patients have a good prognosis while some with severe conditions could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even die. The exacerbation of the patient's condition may be due to a cytokine storm in the body. Effective targeted therapies including antiviral and immunization are urgently needed. Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently. We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral; COVID-19; Immunization; Therapy","alpha interferon; arbidol; azithromycin; Chinese drug; chloroquine; corticosteroid; favipiravir; huashibaidufang; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; jinhua qinggan; lianhua qingwen; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; placebo; qingfeipaidu; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; xuanfeibaidufang; xuebijing; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood clotting disorder; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; disease severity; fatigue; fever; human; metabolic acidosis; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; prognosis; QT prolongation; Review; septic shock; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Key Medical Subjects of Jiangsu Province: ZDRCA2016019

The SARS-CoV-2 causes a clinical syndrome designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) with a spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Few cases have been observed in children and adolescents who seem to have a more favorable clinical course than other age groups, and even fewer in newborn babies. This review provides an overview of the knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, transmission, the associated clinical presentation and outcomes in newborns and infants up to 6 months of life. © 2020 The Author(s).","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Infants; Newborns; SARS-CoV-2","immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; tocilizumab; breast feeding; clinical feature; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; continuous renal replacement therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; extracorporeal oxygenation; high frequency ventilation; human; infection control; maternal fetal transmission; newborn infection; noninvasive ventilation; pandemic; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; throat culture; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; infant; newborn; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Breast Feeding; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Su, S., Wong, G., Shi, W., Liu, J., Lai, A.C.K., Zhou, J., Epidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses (2016) Trends Microbiol, 24, pp. 490-502. , 10.1016/j.tim.2016.03.003 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC28XksVWmsbc%3D 27012512 27012512; Cui, J., Li, F., Shi, Z.-L., Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses (2019) Nat Rev Microbiol, 17, pp. 181-192. , 10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC1cXisVyhtbnL; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med., pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, World Health Organization.

The virus seems to has propensity to infect older male individuals with underlying disease. The clinical features were on a large scale that varies from being an asymptomatic carrier to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Not only, the disease seems to be rare and have a milder course in pediatric age but also respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction, and death are extremely rare. Although several comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are defined as a risk factor for developing the acute respiratory syndrome and need for intensive care; immune-compromised situations such as rheumatic disease which require immunosuppressive treatment strikingly are not found to be a risk factor for more severe disease course. However, there is a lack of data regarding the effects of “Coronavirus disease-2019” on pediatric patients with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, there are three controversial circumstances that patients with rheumatic diseases are believed to be more likely to have viral infections like “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2”, on the other hand, antirheumatic drugs may have a protective and therapeutic role in Coronavirus disease-2019 and children are more unlikely to have serious disease course.

The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of COVID-19 support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SARSCoV virions are preferentially released apically and not at the basement of the airway cells. Thus, in the setting of a productive infection of conducting airway epithelia, the apically released SARS-CoV may be removed by mucociliary clearance and gain access to the GI tract via a luminal exposure. In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis. Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two ""pinchers"" (S1 and 2). The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane. In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications. © 2020 ARAN Ediciones S.A..

It was initially declared as public health emergency if international concern by WHO followed by Pandemic on 12th March 2020. As of 10th April 2020, more than 1.5 million people are affected globally with around 95,000 deaths. Vaccines for this deadly virus are currently under development and many drugs used for other indications have been repurposed and investigated for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID 19. As per SOLIDARITY trial by WHO, some of the most promising candidates include chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine which are anti-malarial medications, Remdesivir, Lopinavir-Ritonavir combination with or without interferon which are anti-HIV drugs and convalescent plasma therapy. The current evidence of efficacy and ongoing research has been elaborated in the article. Besides, there has been evidence regarding inflammatory pathogenesis of this virus leading to cytokine storm in susceptible individuals. Thus, anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs like Anakinra and Tocilizumab are undergoing multiple trials and some results are encouraging. Similarly, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-37 and IL-38 is hypothesised to be useful and is under research. The situation is still evolving and hence there is yet no definitive therapy but to conclude the use of repurposed medications can be a boon till a definitive therapy and vaccines are developed. © 2020 The Authors","Chloroquine; Hydroxychloroquine; Remdesivir","chloroquine; cytokine; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 1; interleukin 37; interleukin 38; interleukin 6; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; unclassified drug; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; drug mechanism; human; nonhuman; pathophysiology; pharmaceutical care; practice guideline; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; Review",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3",,,,,,"Ahmed, S.S., The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19): A Review (2020) Journal of Advances in Medicine and Medical Research, 32; Holmes, K.V., SARS coronavirus: a new challenge for prevention and therapy (2003) J.

It triggers an atypical pneumonia that can progress to multiorgan failure. COVID-19 can cause dysregulation of the immune system, triggering an inflammatory response, and simulate haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Several studies have proposed that anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies, such as tocilizumab, play an important role in the treatment of severe acute respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2. However, the role of anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies, such as anakinra, in the treatment of COVID-19 has not been established. We present a case report of a 51-year-old man diagnosed with severe respiratory infection associated with SARS-CoV-2 that was refractory to antiviral and anti-IL-6 treatment, with a favourable clinical outcome and analytical improvement after treatment with anti-IL-1 (anakinra). © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología","Anakinra; Cytokine storm; SARS-CoV-2; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,"Lai, C.C., Shih, T.P., Ko, W.C., Tang, H.J., Hsueh, P.R., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challenges (2020) Int J Antimicrob Agents., 55, p. 105924; Liang, W., Guan, W., Chen, R., Wang, W., Li, J., Xe, K., Cancer patients in SARS-Cov-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in China (2020) Lancet Oncol., 21, pp. 335-337; Wampler Muskardin, T.L., IV anakinra for macrophage activation syndrome may hold lessons for treatment of cytokine storm in the setting of COVID19 (2020) ACR Open Rheumatol., 2; Binqing Fu, Xiaoling, X., Haiming, W., Why tocilizumab could be an effective treatment for severe COVID-19?

The human cost of COVID pandemic could be extraordinary. We find ourselves in a time of great economic, social, and medical uncertainty. The pandemic demands action on many fronts, from prevention to testing to treatment. We need to create simple, cheap, more accessible testing for SARS-CoV-2. A faster way has to be developed to identify antibodies that neutralize the virus. More than 100 vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 are at various stages of development. Some six groups have already begun injecting formulations into volunteers in safety trials; others have started testing in animals. The biggest challenge is to determine which vaccine is ideal. Reason and science have to guide us. There is urgent need to critically appraise evidence in deciding how to treat patients. We need a drug or com-bination of drugs that work. Remdesivirn-commehas generated hope. It may prove to be a magic bullet. Countries like Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand have done exceptionally well to contain the spread of COVID-19. It is widely believed that during the pandemic treatment suffers. Patients with diseases like cancer, diabetes, renal failure, CAD and pregnant women need special attention. As the pandemic pushes up levels of hunger among the global poor, governments must prevent dev-astating nutrition and health consequences for children missing out on school meals amid school closures. Nations will have endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection for the foreseeable future. A structured and well-coordinated approach is critical for tackling this global crisis. © the Author(s), 2020.","COVID19; Emerging infectious diseases; Pandemic; Social distancing; Socioeconomic impact","adcovid; amnioboost; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; at 100; avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus vaccine; bpi 002; brilacidin; bxt 25; cytodyn leronlimab; DNA vaccine; fusogenix; galidesivir; gimsilumab; ifenprodil; ino 4800; np 120; nucleocapsid protein; oya1; recombinant vaccine; regn3048 3051; remdesivir; sarilumab; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; sng001; subunit vaccine; tjm2; tnx 1800; tocilizumab; tzls 501; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amino acid sequence; Article; asymptomatic disease; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; disease severity; drug development; economics; education; emergency health service; endemic disease; government; health care availability; health care planning; herd immunity; hospital bed capacity; hospitalization; human; immunization; infection control; intensive care unit; kidney failure; lockdown; mortality; pandemic; pneumonia; polymerase chain reaction; poverty; quarantine; RNA interference; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social interaction; stigma; travel; United States; unplanned pregnancy; virus genome; virus transmission",,"brilacidin, 1224095-98-0, 1224095-99-1; galidesivir, 222631-44-9, 249503-25-1; gimsilumab, 1648796-29-5; ifenprodil, 23210-56-2; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9","actemra, Hoffmann La Roche; adcovid, Altimmune; amnioboost, Lattice Biologics; at 100, Airway Therapeutics; bpi 002, Beyondspring,; bxt 25, Bioxytran; cytodyn leronlimab, Applied DNA Sciences; fusogenix, Entos; gs 5734, Gilead; ino 4800, Inovio; np 120, Algernon; oya1, Oyagen; regn3048 3051, Regeneron; sng001, Synairgen; tjm2, I-Mab; tnx 1800, Tonix; tzls 501, Tiziana","Airway Therapeutics; Algernon; Altimmune; Applied DNA Sciences; Beijing Advaccine; Beyondspring,; Biocryst; Bioxytran; Clover; Entos; Gilead; Hoffmann La Roche; I-Mab; Innovation Pharmaceuticals; Inovio; Lattice Biologics; Medicago; MIGAL; Moderna; Oyagen; Regeneron; Roivant; Synairgen; Takis Biotech; Tiziana; Tonix",,,,"Tabish, S.A., Recent trends in emerging infectious diseases (2009) Int J Health Sci (Qassim), 3, pp. 5-8; Tabish, S.A., Nabil, S., The future of humanity and microbes: Impact of emerging infectious diseases on global health economies (2015) IJSR, 4, pp. 2427-2442; Worldometers [Internet]., , https://www.worl-dometers.info/world-population/, Available from; (2019) WHO, , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, Coronavirus disease , (COVID-19) Situation Report; Cascella, M., Rajnik, M., Cuomo, A., Features, evaluation and treatment coronavirus Statpearls [Internet, , (COVID-19); Fauci, A.S., Lane, H.C., Redfield, R.R., Covid-19-navigating the uncharted (2020) N Engl J Med; Kannan, S., Shaik Syed Ali, P., Sheeza, A., Hemalatha, K., COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus 2019)-recent trends (2020) Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci, 24, pp. 2006-2011; Denison, M.R., Graham, R.L., Donaldson, E.F., An RNA proofreading machine regulates replication fidelity and diver-sity (2011) RNA Biol, 8, pp. 270-279; Cohen, J., (2020) The United States Badly Bungled Coronavirus Testing-But Things May Soon Improve.

Treatment is tocilizumab. The use of glucocorticoids (GC) is controversial. In other very similar CSS, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS), the main treatment are corticosteroids. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19. Patients: We included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab. We determine CSS markers. We evaluated mortality, intubation, and a combined variable. Results: In all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered. The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival. Discussion: The early use of GC pulses could control SLC, with a lower requirement to use tocilizumab and a decrease in events such as intubation and death. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U.","Coronavirus COVID-19; Cytokine release synddrome; Hemophagocytic",,,,,,,,,"Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; McGonagle, D., Sharif, K., O'Regan, A., Bridgewood, C., Interleukin-6 use in COVID-19 pneumonia related macrophage activation syndrome (2020) Autoimmun Rev, , 102537; Zhang, W., Zhao, Y., Zhang, F., Wang, Q., Li, T., Liu, Z., The use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): The perspectives of clinical immunologists from China (2020) Clin Immunol, 214, p. 108393; Russell, C.D., Millar, J.E., Baillie, J.K., Clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for 2019-nCoV lung injury (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 473-475; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Zhu, F., Liu, X., Zhang, J., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA., 323, pp. 1061-1069; Wu, C., Chen, X., Cai, Y., Xia, J., Zhou, X., Xu, S., Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) Intern Med; Skinner, J., Yankey, B., Shelton, B.K., Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (2019) AACN Adv Crit Care, 30, pp. 151-164; Lerkvaleekul, B., Vilaiyuk, S., Macrophage activation syndrome: Early diagnosis is key (2018) Open Access Rheumatol, 10, pp. 117-128; Fardet, L., Galicier, L., Lambotte, O., Marzac, C., Aumont, C., Chahwan, D., Development and validation of the HScore, a score for the diagnosis of reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (2014) Arthritis Rheumatol, 66, pp. 2613-2620; Yildiz, H., Van Den Neste, E., Defour, J.P., Danse, E., Yombi, J.C., Adult haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: A review (2020) QJM","Callejas Rubio, J.L.; Unidad de Enfermedades Sistémicas, Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital Universitario Clínico San CecilioSpain; email: jlcalleja@telefonica.net",,,"Ediciones Doyma, S.L.",,,,,00257753,,MCLBA,,"English; Spanish","Med.

The management of these patients is still evolving. Materials and methods: This is a single-center observational cohort study of critically ill patients infected with COVID-19. Bedside clinicians abstracted daily patient data on history, treatment, and short-term course. We describe management and a proposed severity scale for treatment used in this hospital. Results: 44 patients were enrolled; with incomplete information on 11. Of the 33 studied patients, 91% were male, median age 64; 88% were overweight or obese. 45% were hypertensive, 12% had been taking an ACE-inhibitor. Noninvasive ventilation was performed on 39% of patients for part or all or their ICU stay with no provider infection. Most patients received antibiotics for pneumonia. Patients also received lopinivir/ritonavir (82%), hydroxychloroquine (79%), and tocilizumab (12%) according to this treatment algorithm. Nine of 10 patients survived their ICU course and were transferred to the floor, with one dying in the ICU. Conclusions: ICU patients with COVID-19 frequently have hypertension. Many could be managed with noninvasive ventilation, despite the risk of aerosolization. The use of a severity scale augmented clinician management. © 2020 The Authors","COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2","antibiotic agent; carbapenem; cephalosporin; dexamethasone; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrolide; oxygen; penicillin derivative; tocilizumab; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; anamnesis; Article; blood oxygen tension; Brescia Respiratory COVID Severity Scale; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; critically ill patient; disease severity; disease severity assessment; female; human; hypertension; intensive care unit; Italy; male; medical record; middle aged; mortality; noninvasive ventilation; obesity; observational study; patient care; patient transport; pneumonia; positive end expiratory pressure; SARS-related coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; survival rate; treatment outcome",,"carbapenem, 83200-96-8; cephalosporin, 11111-12-9; dexamethasone, 50-02-2; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oxygen, 7782-44-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Medicine SoCC, United States resource availability for COVID-19 (2020), https://sccm.org/Blog/March-2020/United-States-Resource-Availability-for-COVID-19?_zs=jxpjd1&_zl=w9pb6; (2020), Intensiva SIdAAReT.

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19. © 2020","Antimalarials; Baricitinib; CoViD-19; Rheumatic diseases; SARS-CoV2; Tocilizumab","antimalarial agent; antirheumatic agent; baricitinib; biological product; cytokine receptor antagonist; immunomodulating agent; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; antimalarial agent; antirheumatic agent; azetidine derivative; cytokine; IL6 protein, human; immunosuppressive agent; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; monoclonal antibody; sulfonamide; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; biological therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug efficacy; human; nonhuman; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; rheumatic disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; immunology; pandemic; rheumatic disease; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antimalarials; Antirheumatic Agents; Azetidines; Betacoronavirus; Biological Therapy; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rheumatic Diseases; Sulfonamides; Virus Internalization",,"baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antimalarials; Antirheumatic Agents; Azetidines; baricitinib; Cytokines; IL6 protein, human; Immunosuppressive Agents; Interleukin-1; Interleukin-6; Sulfonamides; tocilizumab",,,,,,"Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet (London, England), 395 (10224), pp. 565-574. , Epub 2020/01/30; Xu, X., Yu, C., Qu, J., Zhang, L., Jiang, S., Huang, D., Imaging and clinical features of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2020) Eur.

Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicated a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible). Conclusion: The initial experience from the current pandemic and lessons from the previous two pandemics can help improve future preparedness plans and combat disease progression. © 2020 The Author(s)","2019- nCoV; COVID-19; MERS- CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV- 2","chloroquine; remdesivir; tocilizumab; antiviral therapy; autopsy; case fatality rate; clinical feature; comorbidity; convalescence; coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based medicine; gastrointestinal symptom; human; incubation time; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pandemic; respiratory tract disease; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; virology; virus gene; virus genome; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Assiri, A., Al-Tawfiq, J.A., Al- Rabeeah, A.A., Al-Rabiah, F.A., Al-Hajjar, S., Al-Barrak, A., Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of 47 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease from Saudi Arabia: a descriptive study (2013) Lancet Infect Dis, 13, pp. 752-761; Backer, J.A., Klinkenberg, D., Wallinga, J., Incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections among travellers from Wuhan, China, 20-28 January 2020 (2020) Euro Surveill, p. 25; Badawi, A., Ryoo, S.G., Prevalence of comorbidities in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): a systematic review and meta-analysis (2016) Int J Infect Dis, 49, pp. 129-133; Bauch, C.T., Lloyd-Smith, J.O., Coffee, M.P., Galvani, A.P., Dynamically modeling SARS and other newly emerging respiratory illnesses: past, present, and future (2005) Epidemiology, 16, pp. 791-801; Bauch, C.T., Oraby, T., Assessing the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV (2013) Lancet, 382, pp. 662-664; Chan, J.F., Kok, K.H., Zhu, Z., Chu, H., To, K.K., Yuan, S., Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9, pp. 221-236; Chen, J., Ling, Y., Xi, X.H., Liu, P., Li, F., Li, T., Efficacies of lopinavir/ritonavir and abidol in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (2020) Chin J Epidemiol, 38. , Epub E008; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 507-513; Chen, Q., Wang, L., Xie, M., Li, X., Recommendations for influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination in elderly people in China (2020) Aging Med, pp. 1-11; Coutard, B., Valle, C., de Lamballerie, X., Canard, B., Seidah, N.G., Decroly, E., The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade (2020) Antiviral Res, 176; Cowling, B.J., Park, M., Fang, V.J., Wu, P., Leung, G.M., Wu, J.T., Preliminary epidemiological assessment of MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, May to June 2015 (2015) Euro Surveill, 20, pp. 7-13; Gao, J., Tian, Z., Yang, X., Breakthrough: Chloroquine phosphate has shown apparent efficacy in treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia in clinical studies (2020) Biosci Trends, 14 (1), pp. 72-73; Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S., RJd, G., Drosten, C., Gulyaeva, A.A., Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus—The species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2020); Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032?url_ver=Z39.88-2003=rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org=rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed, [accessed 28 Feb 2020].

In this article, the extent to which major publishers have provided access for the public to read research articles relevant to potential drug candidates for the COVID-19 disease are presented. A systematic search of five electronic databases (Elsevier ’s ScienceDirect, Taylor & Francis, SpringerLink, Wiley, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)) was conducted on April 12–17, 2020. The total number of research articles containing terms ‘Ribavirin,’ ‘Remdesivir,’ ‘Hydroxychlo-roquine OR Chloroquine,’ ‘Favipiravir,’ ‘Lopinavir OR Ritonavir,’ ‘Sari-lumab,’ and ‘Tocilizumab,’ available for the public to read for free were determined.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the human cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. ACE2 expression increases on lung alveolar epithelial cells and adipose tissue due to obesity, smoking and air pollution. A significant relationship exists between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection, as more severe COVID-19 symptoms occur in smokers; comorbid conditions due to obesity or excess ectopic fat accumulation as underlying risk factors for severe COVID-19 strongly encourage the virus/ACE2 receptor-ligand interaction concept. Indeed, obesity, air pollution and smoking associated risk factors share underlying pathophysiologies that are related to the Renin-Angiotensin-System in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this review is to emphasize the mechanism of receptor-ligand interaction and its impact on the enhanced risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Angiotensin II; Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors; COVID-19; Obesity; Smoking","angiotensin 1 receptor; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin I; angiotensin II; nicotine; nitrogen dioxide; tobacco smoke; tocilizumab; air pollution; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug targeting; endothelial dysfunction; environmental exposure; human; hypertension; inflammation; mortality; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; prognosis; protein expression; receptor binding; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; smoking",,"angiotensin I, 9041-90-1; angiotensin II, 11128-99-7, 68521-88-0; nicotine, 54-11-5; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Alifano, M., Alifano, P., Forgez, P., Iannelli, A., Renin-angiotensin system at the heart of COVID-19 pandemic (2020) Biochimie, 174, pp. 30-33; Alzghari, S.K., Acuña, V.S., Supportive treatment with Tocilizumab for COVID-19: a systematic review (2020) J.

At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 200 000 patients and associated with over 8000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization). On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options. It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, including infectious diseases pharmacists and physicians, are at the forefront of COVID-19 emergency preparedness. We encourage all readers to continue to assess clinical data as it emerges and share their experience within our community in a well-controlled, adequately powered fashion. © The Author(s) 2020.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV 2) has rapidly spread worldwide with increasing hospitalization and mortality rate. Ongoing studies and accumulated data are detailing the features and the effects of the new coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) in the adult population, and cardiovascular involvement is emerging as the most significant and life-threatening complication, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. At present, though the limited data on the effects of COVID 19 in pediatric patients, children seem to count for a little proportion of SARS-COV 2 infection, and present with less severe disease and effects However infants and toddlers are at risk of developing critical course. The disease has a range of clinical presentations in children, for which the potential need for further investigation of myocardial injury and cardiovascular issues should be kept in mind to avoid misdiagnosing severe clinical entities. Overlapping with Kawasaki disease is a concern, particularly the incomplete and atypical form. We aim to summarize the initial considerations and potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 for children and patients with congenital heart disease.

COVID-19 requires the collaboration of nearly 200 countries to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while gaining time to explore and improve treatment options especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and immunocompromised patients, who appear to be at high-risk to die from cardiopulmonary failure. Currently unanswered questions are why elderly people, particularly those with pre-existing comorbidities seem to exhibit higher mortality rates after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether intensive care becomes indispensable for these patients to prevent multi-organ failure and sudden death. To face these challenges, we here summarize the molecular insights into viral infection mechanisms and implications for cardiovascular disease. Since the infection starts in the upper respiratory system, first flu-like symptoms develop that spread throughout the body. The wide range of affected organs is presumably based on the common expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry-receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Physiologically, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, the master regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), thereby converting it into vasodilatory molecules, which have well-documented cardio-protective effects. Thus, RAAS inhibitors, which may increase the expression levels of ACE2, are commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and CVD. This, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks ACE2 for cell-entry, have spurred controversial discussions on the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-dependent mechanisms and the potential interaction with ACE2 expression and cell surface localization. We aim to provide a list of potential treatment options and a better understanding of why CVD is a high risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and further discuss the acute as well as long-term cardiac consequences. © 2020 The Authors","ACE2; Cardiovascular disease; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2","alpha interferon; anakinra; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; azithromycin; camostat mesilate; chloroquine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; favipiravir; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; losartan; neutralizing antibody; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; ribavirin; siltuximab; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Article; cardiovascular disease; cell surface; cellular distribution; coronavirus disease 2019; disease activity; drug safety; drug targeting; enzyme mechanism; heart arrhythmia; hemophilia; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; hypertriglyceridemia; infection risk; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; protein expression; protein interaction; QT prolongation; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tachycardia; thrombosis; torsade des pointes",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; angiotensin II, 11128-99-7, 68521-88-0; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; camostat mesilate, 59721-29-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; losartan, 114798-26-4; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; umifenovir, 131707-25-0",,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: KFO311, TRR267

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus. © The Author(s) 2020.

This beta gene virus, very close to bat coronaviruses (bat-CoV-RaTG13) and bat-SL-CoVZC45, causes a severe disease, similar to those caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV viruses, featured by low to moderate mortality rate. Unfortunately, the antiviral drugs commonly used in clinical practice to treat viral infections, are not applicable to SARS-Cov-2 and no vaccine is available. Thus, it is extremely necessary to identify new drugs suitable for the treatment of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Different preclinical studies conducted on other coronaviruses suggested that promising clinical outcomes for 2019-nCoV should be obtained by using alpha-interferon, chloroquine phosphate, arabinol, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, clinical trials with these suitable drugs should be performed on patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 to prove their efficacy and safety. Finally, a very promising therapeutic drug, tocilizumab, is discussed; it is currently used to treat patients presenting COVID-19 pneumonia. Herein, we recapitulate these experimental studies to highlight the use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2 disease.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, Tuscan outpatients with systemic autoimmune diseases followed at a tertiary referral centre were telephonically interviewed between April 1st-14th 2020 to collect demographic and clinical data, information on ongoing immunomodulating/immunosuppressive treatments, and on the presence of symptoms suspected of SARS-CoV-2 or of a confirmed infection. Results: 458 patients were interviewed [74% female, median age 56 years (IQR 43–68)]; 56% of them were receiving corticosteroids, 44% traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), of whom 23% hydroxychloroquine, 5% colchicine, while 41% were on biologic DMARDs (of whom 9% on tocilizumab). Thirteen patients reported symptoms suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of them, 7 had undergone nasopharyngeal swab and only one was positive and developed severe SARS-CoV-2 complications. Within our cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was therefore 0.22% (0.01–1.21%), comparable to that observed in the general population of Tuscany [0.20% (0.20–0.21%), p = .597]. Conclusions: Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases do not seem to carry an increased risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population. © 2020","COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunosuppressants; Systemic autoimmune diseases; Tocilizumab","antirheumatic agent; colchicine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult; aged; autoimmune disease; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; cross-sectional study; female; human; Italy; male; middle aged; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antirheumatic Agents; Autoimmune Diseases; Betacoronavirus; Colchicine; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,"colchicine, 64-86-8; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antirheumatic Agents; Colchicine; Hydroxychloroquine; tocilizumab",,,,,,"Guan, W., Ni, Z., Hu, Y., Liang, W., Ou, C., He, J., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Ye, Q., Wang, B., Mao, J., Cytokine storm in COVID-19 and treatment (2020) J Infect; Onder, G., Rezza, G., Brusaferro, S., Case-fatality rate and characteristics of patients dying in relation to COVID-19 in Italy (2020) JAMA - J Am Med Assoc; Bhoori, S., Rossi, R.E., Citterio, D., Mazzaferro, V., COVID-19 in long-term liver transplant patients: preliminary experience from an Italian transplant Centre in Lombardy (2020) Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol; Figueroa-Parra, G., Aguirre-Garcia, G.M., Gamboa-Alonso, C.M., Camacho-Ortiz, A., Galarza-Delgado, D.A., Are my patients with rheumatic diseases at higher risk of COVID-19?

We reviewed the risk stratification of patients with rheumatological disorders, the safety of various anti-rheumatological drugs, and the role of multiple drugs used by the rheumatologists in managing COVID-19. The score-based risk stratification is helpful in therapeutic decision-making such as self-isolation, continuation, or initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Most of the immunosuppressive therapies need not be discontinued unless there is an overwhelming infection. The treatment interruption should not be made in fear, and there should be shared decision-making in consultation with the patient. The proposed role of different anti-rheumatic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in COVID-19 based on some initial uncontrolled trials and case reports will become clearer when the results of various ongoing well-planned studies become available. © 2020 Indian Journal of Rheumatology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Coronavirus disease-19; hydroxychloroquine; rheumatology; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; tocilizumab","antirheumatic agent; biological product; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; hydroxychloroquine; immunomodulating agent; immunosuppressive agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; steroid; tocilizumab; Article; biological therapy; clinical decision making; consultation; coronavirus disease 2019; drug safety; high risk patient; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infection prevention; isolation; meta analysis (topic); multicenter study (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); rheumatic disease; rheumatologist; risk assessment; self concept; self isolation; shared decision making; steroid therapy; treatment interruption",,"hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: Implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 565-574; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., To, K.K., Chu, H., Yang, J., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 514-523; Phan, L.T., Nguyen, T.V., Luong, Q.C., Nguyen, T.V., Nguyen, H.T., Le, H.Q., Importation and human-to-human trans-mission of a novel coronavirus in Vietnam (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 872-874; Rothe, C., Schunk, M., Sothmann, P., Bretzel, G., Froeschl, G., Wallrauch, C., Transmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 970-971; Wu, J.T., Leung, K., Leung, G.M., Now casting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: A modelling study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 689-697; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1199-1207; (2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200330-sitrep-70-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=7e0fe3f82, Last accessed on Mar 31; Joo, Y.B., Lim, Y.H., Kim, K.J., Park, K.S., Park, Y.J., Respiratory viral infections and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (2019) Arthritis Res Ther, 21, p. 199; (2020), https://www.rheumatology.org.uk/news-policy/details/Covid19-coronavirus-update-members, BritishSocietyforRheumatology.

The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ARDS. Our case is unique in its atypical initial presentation and highlights the importance of early testing. © 2020 S.

No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials.

The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects. It is tempting to speculate that inositol could be beneficial in managing the most dreadful effects of Sars-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57–79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the “cytokine storm syndrome”, a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34–35 °C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40°–41 °C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8–5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death. © 2020","Aerosol vaporization and nebulization; Alcoholic gargle; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; IL-1/IL-6; Monoclonal antibody; Povidone-iodine gargle and eye drop; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2; Viral pneumonia","azithromycin; chloroquine; colchicine; heparin; metformin; nicotinamide riboside; rapamycin; remdesivir; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug structure; hospitalization; human; in vitro study; inhalational drug administration; nebulization; positive end expiratory pressure; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaporization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; nicotinamide riboside, 1341-23-7; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Ylikoski, J.A., Savolainen, S.A., Jousimies-Somer, H., Bacterial flora in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of healthy young men (1989) ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec, 51 (1), pp. 50-55; (2000), www.icsi.org, Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.

Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other.

Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy. Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs). It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals. METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature. RESULTS: Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician. Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight. CONCLUSIONS: With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation. Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.",,"adenosine phosphate; alanine; antivirus agent; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; immunosuppressive agent; monoclonal antibody; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; tocilizumab; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug interaction; drug monitoring; graft recipient; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Interactions; Drug Monitoring; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunosuppressive Agents; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protease Inhibitors; Transplant Recipients",,"adenosine phosphate, 61-19-8, 8063-98-7; alanine, 56-41-7, 6898-94-8; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; proteinase inhibitor, 37205-61-1; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Glucocorticoids; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunosuppressive Agents; Protease Inhibitors; remdesivir; tocilizumab",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15363694,,,"32304488","English","Ther Drug Monit",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083865713

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest on a spectrum of illness from mild disease to severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit admission. As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions. There is currently no widely accepted standard of care in the pharmacologic management of patients with COVID-19. Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority. Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immunomodulating therapies. Many have demonstrated in vitro or in vivo potential against other viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 have additional considerations related to adjustments for organ impairment and renal replacement therapies, complex lists of concurrent medications, limitations with drug administration and compatibility, and unique toxicities that should be evaluated when utilizing these therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize practical considerations for pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19, with the intent of serving as a resource for health care providers at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic. © 2020 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","antivirals;

Material and methods: We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from 14 March to 14 April 2020. Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected. An analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables. A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables. Results: A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5% each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%). Forty-one women (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 because of disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 women (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics, and tocilizumab. No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported. Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease. Median CRP, D-dimer, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated. High CRP and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk 6.65; 95% CI 4.1-5.9). During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally. All newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in placental tissue. Conclusions: Most of the pregnant women with COVID-19 had a favorable clinical course. However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status. CRP and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically. Seventy-eight percent of the women had a vaginal delivery. No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding. © 2020 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology","breastfeeding; coronavirus 2; coronavirus disease-2019; labor; newborn; pregnancy; severe acute respiratory syndrome; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vertical transmission",,,,,,,"We are very grateful to Concepci?n Payares Herrera for advice about English translation and improve the quality of the manuscript.",,"Zhou, P., Yang, X.-L., Wang, X.-G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 270-273; Statement on the second meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), , https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov, Jan 30, 2020., (accessed Feb 29, 2020); Report on current pneumonia epidemic situation in the city, , http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989, (In Chinese.)

Cesare 11, Bari, I-70124, Italy","The current pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a global health emergency because of its highly contagious nature, the great number of patients requiring intensive care therapy, and the high fatality rate. In the absence of specific antiviral drugs, passive prophylaxis, or a vaccine, the treatment aim in these patients is to prevent the potent virus-induced inflammatory stimuli from leading to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a severe prognosis. Here, the mechanism of action and the rationale for employing immunological strategies, which range from traditional chemically synthesized drugs, anti-cytokine antibodies, human immunoglobulin for intravenous use, to vaccines, are reviewed. © 2020 by the authors.

Patients with malignant diseases are assumed to be at increased risk for a worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, guidance regarding prevention and management of the infection as well as safe administration of cancer-therapy is required. Here, we provide recommendations for the management of patients with malignant disease in the times of COVID-19. These recommendations were prepared by an international panel of experts and then consented by the EHA Scientific Working Group on Infection in Hematology. The primary aim is to enable clinicians to provide optimal cancer care as safely as possible, since the most important protection for patients with malignant disease is the best-possible control of the underlying disease. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"chloroquine; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; remdesivir; ribavirin; ruxolitinib; steroid; tocilizumab; Article; chemotherapy; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic procedure; disease control; disease course; disease severity; general practitioner; health care management; hematologist; hematology; human; immunosuppressive treatment; infection prevention; infection risk; lower respiratory tract infection; malignant neoplasm; oncologist; patient safety; pediatrics; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease transmission; infection control; neoplasm; pandemic; patient care; practice guideline; prevention and control; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Patient Care; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; La Rosee, P., Horne, A., Hines, M., von Bahr Greenwood, T., Machowicz, R., Berliner, N., Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults (2019) Blood, 133, pp. 2465-2477; Chen, J., Wang, X., Zhang, S., Findings of acute pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=3548771; Ison, M.G., Hirsch, H.H., Community-acquired respiratory viruses in transplant patients: diversity, impact, unmet clinical needs (2019) Clin Microbiol Rev, , https://doi.org/10.1128/CMR.00042-19; Hermann, B., Lehners, N., Brodhun, M., Boden, K., Hochhaus, A., Kochanek, M., Influenza virus infections in patients with malignancies–characteristics and outcome of the season 2014/15.

Since its discovery more than 40 years ago, the IL-6 pathway has emerged as a pivotal pathway involved in immune regulation in health and dysregulation in many diseases. Targeting of the IL-6 pathway has led to innovative therapeutic approaches for various rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult-onset Still’s disease, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, as well as other conditions such as Castleman disease and cytokine release syndrome. Targeting this pathway has also identified avenues for potential expansion into several other indications, such as uveitis, neuromyelitis optica and, most recently, COVID-19 pneumonia. To mark the tenth anniversary of anti-IL-6 receptor therapy worldwide, we discuss the history of research into IL-6 biology and the development of therapies that target IL-6 signalling, including the successes and challenges and with an emphasis on rheumatic diseases. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"clazakizumab; interleukin 6; olokizumab; sarilumab; siltuximab; sirukumab; tocilizumab; biological factor; interleukin 6; adult onset Still disease; angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia; antibody production; aortic arch syndrome; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine release syndrome; drug efficacy; drug safety; genetic transcription; giant cell arteritis; human; immunoregulation; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; myelooptic neuropathy; nonhuman; Note; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus; T lymphocyte; transgenic mouse; uveitis; vasculitis; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; global health; immunology; pandemic; rheumatic disease; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Biological Factors; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Interleukin-6; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rheumatic Diseases",,"clazakizumab, 1236278-28-6; olokizumab, 1007223-17-7; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; sirukumab, 1194585-53-9; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Biological Factors; Interleukin-6",,,"Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation

Initially, infection presented with a broad spectrum of symptoms which typically included muscle aches, fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE2 receptors which are abundant throughout the respiratory tract. However, there is evidence that these receptors are abundant throughout the body, and just as abundant in cholangiocytes as alveolar cells, posing the question of possible direct liver injury. While liver enzymes and function tests do seem to be deranged in some patients, it is questionable if the injury is due to direct viral damage, drug-induced liver injury, hypoxia, or microthromboses. Likely, the injury is multifactoral, and management of infected patients with pre-existing liver disease should be taken into consideration. Ultimately, a vaccine is needed to aid in reducing cases of SARS-CoV-2 and providing immunity to the general population. However, while considering the types of vaccines available, safety concerns, particularly of RNA-or DNA-based vaccines, need to be addressed. © 2020 by the authors.
