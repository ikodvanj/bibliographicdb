After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5-19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by an 11- year-old SARS-CoV-2-positive female who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission. © 2020","Child; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Enoxaparin; Pediatric; Remdesivir; Septic; Shock; Tocilizumab",,,,,,,"Special thanks to the Kings County Hospital Center Emergency Department staff for their dedication and strength during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"Dong, E., Du, H., Gardner, L., An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, 20 (5), pp. 533-534; Lu, X., Zhang, L., Du, H., SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (17), pp. 1663-1665; Ludvigsson, J.F., Systematic review of COVID-19 in children shows milder cases and a better prognosis than adults (2020) Acta Paediatr, 109 (6), pp. 1088-1095; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00432.asp, (Accessed 26 May 2020); Balasubramanian, S., Nagendran, T.M., Ramachandran, B., Ramanan, A.V., Hyper-inflammatory syndrome in a child with COVID-19 treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and tocilizumab (2020) Indian Pediatr, , published online ahead of print, 2020 May 10 [S097475591600180]; Verdoni, L., Mazza, A., Gervasoni, A., An outbreak of severe Kawasaki-like disease at the Italian epicentre of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic: an observational cohort study [published online ahead of print, 2020 May 13].

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients’ own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients. In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis… 1. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance. 2. Institute appropriate safeguards to avoid negative consequences from unscrupulous actors. 3. With proper informed consent from patients or proxy when necessary, and subject to accumulation of data in that cohort, allow the procedure to be initiated in critically ill patients who are not responding to conventional therapies. © 2020, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

The airline industry has faced many threats throughout history, but none quite as rapid and severe as the one posed by the spread of COVID-19. One constant during uncertainty shocks and industry downturns is that airline labor bears the brunt of the decline. As the industry reduces capacity amid the increase in travel restrictions, the post-stimulus impacts to airline labor are not known. Using time series analysis, the dynamics of historical uncertainty shocks to the industry are examined. During periods of uncertainty shocks, the estimated job loss is nearly 7% of the airline workforce with an upper bound of over 13%. Major airline employment is most impacted, while low-cost and regional airline employment is least impacted. The hardest hit employees are ones related to passenger handling and flight operations, while management employees fair slightly better during these uncertain periods. Further, recovery following uncertainty shocks is estimated to take between 4 and 6 years. Overall, the labor impacts to the airline industry from uncertainty events are substantial and provide insight into the expected industry job loss from COVID-19. © 2020","Airline labor; COVID-19; Recessions; Uncertainty; Unemployment",,,,,,,,,"Alessandri, P., Mumtaz, H., Financial regimes and uncertainty shocks (2019) J.

Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICU) and premature death. The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological and inflammatory responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat deposits. Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called “obesity paradox” commonly reported in ICU among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, the presence of obesity increases the risk of worse outcome at a younger age. These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19. © 2020","ARDS; COVID-19; Intensive care; Mechanical ventilation; Mortality; Prognosis",,,,,,,,,"Bhasker, A.G., Greve, J.W., Are patients suffering from severe obesity getting a raw deal during COVID-19 pandemic?

CASE PRESENTATION: A 78 years old woman was admitted to the Emergency Unit with respiratory symptoms, confusion and cyanosis at the extremity, in particular at the nose area, hands and feet fingers. A nasal swab for COVID-19 was performed, which resulted positive, and so therapy with doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents was started. At admission, the patient was hemodynamically unstable requiring circulatory support with liquids and norepinephrine; laboratory tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During hospitalization, the clinical condition worsened and the cyanosis of the nose, fingers, and toes rapidly increased and became dried gangrene in three days. Subsequently, the neurological state deteriorated into a coma and the patient died. DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 could be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. This case report shows the quick development of dried gangrene in a non-vasculopathic patient, as a consequence of COVID-19's coagulopathy and DIC. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, COVID-19 related coagulopathy was associated with poor prognosis. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

This approach ignores how systems interact and how their systemic properties shape socioeconomic outcomes, leading to an over-emphasis on a limited set of characteristics, notably efficiency. We argue that this emphasis on efficiency in the operation, management and outcomes of various economic and social systems is not a conscious collective choice, but rather the response of the whole system to the incentives that individual components face. This has brought much of the world to rely upon complex, nested, and interconnected systems to deliver goods and services around the globe. While this approach has many benefits, the Covid-19 crisis shows how it has also reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks, and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others. This paper reviews the impact of COVID-19 on socioeconomic systems, discusses the notion of resilience, and provides specific recommendations on both integrating resilience analytics for recovery from the current crisis as well as on building resilient infrastructure to address future systemic challenges. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Economic impact; OECD; Resilience; Risk",,,,,,,,,"Aubin, J.P., Une approche viabiliste du couplage des systèmes climatique et économique (2010) Nat Sci Soc, 18, pp. 277-286; Epstein, J., (2014) Agent_Zero: toward neurocognitive foundations for generative social science, , Princeton University Press, Trenton; Ferguson, N.M., (2020), https://doi.org/10.25561/77482, Preprint at Spiral; Fujimoto, T., (2011) Supply Chain Competitiveness and Robustness: A Lesson from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and Supply Chain ‘Virtual Dualization’, , https://merc.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mmrc/dp/pdf/MMRC362_2011.pdf, MMRC Discussion Paper Series, N°362; Ganin, A.A., Kitsak, M., Marchese, D., Keisler, J.M., Seager, T., Linkov, I., Resilience and efficiency in transportation networks (2017) Sci Adv, 3 (12); Ganin, A.A., Operational resilience: concepts, design and analysis (2016) Sci Rep, 6, p. 19540. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC28Xht1elsr0%3D; Golan, M.S., Jernegan, L.H., Linkov, I., (2020) Trends and Applications of Resilience Analytics in Supply Chain Modeling: Systematic Literature Review in the Context of the COVID Pandemic, , Environment, Systems and Decisions; Haldane, A.G., Rethinking the financial network (2009) BIS Review, , https://www.bis.org/review/r090505e.pdf; Systemic Risks in Society and Economics, , Social self-organization, Springer, Berlin; (2020) Global Debt Database, , https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets/GDD; (2018) Guidelines for the Governance of Systemic Risks: In Systems and Organisations In the Context of Transitions, , ETH Zurich; Johnson, C.K., Global shifts in mammalian population trends reveal key predictors of virus spillover risk (2020) Proc R Soc B; Linkov, I., Trump, B.D., Hynes, W., (2019) Resilience strategies and policies to contain systemic threats; Linkov, I., Trump, B.D., Poinsatte-Jones, K., Love, P., Hynes, W., Ramos, G., Resilience at OECD: current state and future directions (2018) IEEE Eng.

Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. Methods: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. Results: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3–89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1–71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2–52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3–27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1–9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6–18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1–6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5–1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6–13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7–10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6–3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9–8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0–61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4–56.9 %), respectively. Conclusion: Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Comorbidities; COVID-19; Mortality; Severity; Symptom","acute kidney failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dyspnea; fatigue; fever; heart injury; human; hypertension; infection risk; meta analysis; mortality rate; mortality risk; prevalence; priority journal; Review; sex ratio; shock; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; China; complication; Coronavirus infection; diabetic complication; incidence; mortality; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Diabetes Complications; Fever; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,"Rothan, H.A., Byrareddy, S.N., The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak (2020) J.

Medical Treatment Expert Group for COPD and COVID-19","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been a global pandemic disease, with more than 4 million cases and nearly 300,000 deaths. Little is known about COVID-19 in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to evaluate the influence of preexisting COPD on the progress and outcomes of COVID-19. Methods: This was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study. We enrolled 1,048 patients aged 40 years and above, including 50 patients with COPD and 998 patients without COPD, and with COVID-19 confirmed via high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, between December 11, 2019 and February 20, 2020. We collected data of demographics, pathologic test results, radiologic imaging, and treatments. The primary outcomes were composite endpoints determined by admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Compared with patients who had COVID-19 but not COPD, those with COPD had higher ratesof fatigue (56.0% vs. 40.2%), dyspnea (66.0% vs. 26.3%), diarrhea (16.0% vs. 3.6%), and unconsciousness (8.0% vs. 1.7%) and a significantly higher proportion of increased activated partial thromboplastin time (23.5% vs. 5.2%) and D-dimer (65.9% vs. 29.3%), as well as ground-glass opacities (77.6% vs. 60.3%), local patchy shadowing (61.2% vs. 41.4%), and interstitial abnormalities (51.0% vs. 19.8%) on chest computed tomography. Patients with COPD were more likely to develop bacterial or fungal coinfection (20.0% vs. 5.9%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (20.0% vs. 7.3%), septic shock (14.0% vs. 2.3%), or acute renal failure (12.0% vs. 1.3%). Patients with COPD and COVID-19 had a higher risk of reaching the composite endpoints [hazard ratio (HR): 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-3.38; P=0.001] or death (HR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.15-4.51; P=0.019), after adjustment. Conclusions: In this study, patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 showed a higher risk of admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

However, approximately 1 month after the COVID-19 peak in New York City in April 2020, cases of children with prolonged fevers abruptly developing inflammatory shock-like states have been reported in Western Europe and the United States. This case series describes four previously healthy children with COVID-19 infection confirmed by serologic antibody testing, but negative by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab, presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) with prolonged fever (5 or more days) and abrupt onset of hemodynamic instability with elevated serologic inflammatory markers and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α). Emergency physicians must maintain a high clinical suspicion for this COVID-19 associated post-infectious cytokine release syndrome, with features that overlap with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) in children with recent or current COVID-19 infection, as patients can decompensate quickly. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Children; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Kawasaki Disease",,,,,,,,,"Dong, Y., Mo, X., Hu, Y., Epidemiology of COVID-19 among children in China (2020) Pediatrics; Fang, F., Luo XP.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population includes 99 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 4 March and 25 March 2020. Fifty-three patients with a history of cardiac disease were compared with 46 without cardiac disease. Among cardiac patients, 40% had a history of heart failure, 36% had atrial fibrillation, and 30% had coronary artery disease. Mean age was 67 ± 12 years, and 80 (81%) patients were males. No differences were found between cardiac and non-cardiac patients except for higher values of serum creatinine, N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide, and high sensitivity troponin T in cardiac patients. During hospitalization, 26% patients died, 15% developed thrombo-embolic events, 19% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 6% had septic shock. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease compared with the others (36% vs. 15%, log-rank P = 0.019; relative risk 2.35; 95% confidence interval 1.08-5.09). The rate of thrombo-embolic events and septic shock during the hospitalization was also higher in cardiac patients (23% vs. 6% and 11% vs. 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.

In the early stage, we encountered a small but meaningful number of patients who were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19. We intended to describe their clinical characteristics and outcomes. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 34 patients underwent elective surgeries during the incubation period of COVID-19 at Renmin Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital, Tongji Hospital and Central Hospital in Wuhan, from January 1 to February 5, 2020. Findings: Of the 34 operative patients, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43–63), and 20 (58·8%) patients were women. All patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after surgery with abnormal findings on chest computed tomographic scans. Common symptoms included fever (31 [91·2%]), fatigue (25 [73·5%]) and dry cough (18 [52·9%]). 15 (44·1%) patients required admission to intensive care unit (ICU) during disease progression, and 7 patients (20·5%) died after admission to ICU. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients were older, were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, underwent more difficult surgeries, as well as more severe laboratory abnormalities (eg, hyperleukocytemia, lymphopenia). The most common complications in non-survivors included ARDS, shock, arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury. Interpretation: In this retrospective cohort study of 34 operative patients with confirmed COVID-19, 15 (44·1%) patients needed ICU care, and the mortality rate was 20·5%.

A 48-year-old man with obesity was hospitalized with a severe form of COVID-19 infection, complicated with acute respiratory failure, septic shock, dilated cardiomyopathy and fungemia. Despite treatment with prophylactic enoxaparin (initial D-Dimer 1.14 µg/ml FEU (normal < 0.05 µg/ml FEU), D-Dimer increased to above 20 µg/ml FEU and patient continued to spike high fevers. This prompted further investigations and upper and lower extremities DVTs were confirmed and managed with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. D-dimer level decreased to 4.98 µg/ml FEU while on therapeutic anticoagulation. Three weeks later pending hospital discharge, the anticoagulation was switched to oral apixaban 10 mg twice daily. Patient developed acute severe right eye visual loss of no light perception and was diagnosed with incomplete OAO. D-Dimer was elevated at 2.13 µg/ml FEU. Stroke etiological work-up found no embolic sources, resolution of the dilated cardiomyopathy and negative antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment was changed to enoxaparin and no thrombotic events were encountered to date. Ocular vascular complications have not yet been reported in COVID-19. Controversy exists on the best management algorithm for the hypercoagulable state associated to COVID-19 Either direct oral anticoagulants or low-molecular-weight-heparin are considered appropriate at discharge for patients with venous thromboembolism. The optimum regimen for ischemic stroke prevention and the significance of D-Dimer for anticoagulation monitoring in COVID-19 remain unclear. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anticoagulation; COVID-19; Ophthalmic artery occlusion; Stroke","antibiotic agent; apixaban; D dimer; enoxaparin; hydroxychloroquine; tocilizumab; acute respiratory failure; adult; anticoagulant therapy; artery occlusion; Article; blood level; candidiasis; case report; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; fever; fungemia; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; hypoxemia; kidney injury; lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; ophthalmic artery; priority journal; prophylaxis; respiratory failure; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; thrombocytosis; visual impairment",,"apixaban, 503612-47-3; enoxaparin, 679809-58-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"UL1-RR025008

Severe complications have been reported to occur in 33% of patients with COVID-19 and include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, acute respiratory injury, septic shock, and severe pneumonia. Currently, there is no specific treatment or approved vaccine against COVID-19 and many clinical trials are currently investigating potential medications to treat COVID-19. The immunosuppressed status of some cancer patients (whether caused by the disease itself or the treatment) increases their risk of infection compared with the general population. This short review aims to focus on the impact of COVID-19 on a cancer patient and discuss management options and recommendation in addition to highlighting the currently available clinical guidelines and resources. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The clinical information in caring of critically ill patients with COVID-19 needs to be shared timely, especially under the situations that there is still a largely ongoing spread of COVID-19 in many countries. Methods: A multicenter prospective observational study investigated all the COVID-19 patients received in 19 ICUs of 16 hospitals in Wuhan, China, over 24 h between 8 AM February 2h and 8 AM February 27, 2020. The demographic information, clinical characteristics, vital signs, complications, laboratory values, and clinical managements of the patients were studied. Results: A total of 226 patients were included. Their median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 64 (57-70) years, and 139 (61.5%) patients were male. The duration from the date of ICU admission to the study date was 11 (5-17) days, and the duration from onset of symptoms to the study date was 31 (24-36) days. Among all the patients, 155 (68.6%) had at least one coexisting disease, and their sequential organ failure assessment score was 4 (2-8). Organ function damages were found in most of the patients: ARDS in 161 (71.2%) patients, septic shock in 34 (15.0%) patients, acute kidney injury occurred in 57 (25.2%) patients, cardiac injury in 61 (27.0%) patients, and lymphocytopenia in 160 (70.8%) patients. Of all the studied patients, 85 (37.6%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, including 14 (6.2%) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the same time, 20 (8.8%) received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 24 (10.6%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. By April 9, 2020, 87 (38.5%) patients were deceased and 15 (6.7%) were still in the hospital. Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with a higher risk of severe complications and need to receive an intensive level of treatments. COVID-19 poses a great strain on critical care resources in hospitals. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2000030164.

Adequate understanding of the interplay between COVID-19 and CV disease is required for optimum management of these patients. Methods: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. Results: Respiratory illness is the dominant clinical manifestation of COVID-19; CV involvement occurs much less commonly. Acute cardiac injury, defined as significant elevation of cardiac troponins, is the most commonly reported cardiac abnormality in COVID-19. It occurs in approximately 8–12% of all patients. Direct myocardial injury due to viral involvement of cardiomyocytes and the effect of systemic inflammation appear to be the most common mechanisms responsible for cardiac injury. The information about other CV manifestations in COVID-19 is very limited at present. Nonetheless, it has been consistently shown that the presence of pre-existing CV disease and/or development of acute cardiac injury are associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. Conclusions: Most of the current reports on COVID-19 have only briefly described CV manifestations in these patients. Given the enormous burden posed by this illness and the significant adverse prognostic impact of cardiac involvement, further research is required to understand the incidence, mechanisms, clinical presentation and outcomes of various CV manifestations in COVID-19 patients. © 2020 Diabetes India","Arrhythmia; Cardiac troponins; Cardiogenic shock; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; Heart failure; Myocardial infarction; Myocarditis; SARS-CoV-2","antivirus agent; troponin; antiviral therapy; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; clinical outcome; comorbidity; coronary artery thrombosis; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; electrolyte disturbance; heart arrhythmia; heart injury; heart muscle injury; human; inflammation; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,,,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: summary of a report of 72314 cases from the Chinese center for disease Control and prevention (2020) J Am Med Assoc; The world health organization coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation report –61 https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200321-sitrep-61-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=f201f85c_2, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020); Xiong, T.Y., Redwood, S., Prendergast, B., Chen, M., Coronaviruses and the cardiovascular system: acute and long-term implications (2020) Eur Heart J; Li, B., Yang, J., Zhao, F., Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China (2020) Clin Res Cardiol; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Chen, D., Li, X., song, Q., Hu, C., Su, F., Dai, J., Hypokalemia and clinical implications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) medRxiv; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) J Am Med Assoc; Arentz, M., Yim, E., Klaff, L., Characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically Ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington state (2020) J Am Med Assoc; Lippi, G., Plebani, M., Laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-2019 infection (2020) Clin Chem Lab Med; Oudit, G.Y., Kassiri, Z., Jiang, C., SARS-coronavirus modulation of myocardial ACE2 expression and inflammation in patients with SARS (2009) Eur J Clin Invest, 39, pp. 618-625; Wu, Q., Zhou, L., Sun, X., Altered lipid metabolism in recovered SARS patients twelve years after infection (2017) Sci Rep, 7, p. 9110; Corrales-Medina, V.F., Alvarez, K.N., Weissfeld, L.A., Association between hospitalization for pneumonia and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease (2015) J Am Med Assoc, 313, pp. 264-274; Tam, C.F., Cheung, K.S., Lam, S., Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction care in Hong Kong, China (2020) Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, , CIRCOUTCOMES120006631; ACC clinical bulletin focuses on cardiac implications of coronavirus (COVID-19) https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/02/13/12/42/acc-clinical-bulletin-focuses-on-cardiac-implications-of-coronavirus-2019-ncov, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020); ASE statement on COVID-19 https://www.asecho.org/ase-statement-covid-19/, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020); Ferrario, C.M., Jessup, J., Chappell, M.C., Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II receptor blockers on cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (2005) Circulation, 111, pp. 2605-2610; HFSA/ACC/AHA statement addresses concerns Re: using RAAS antagonists in COVID-19 https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/17/08/59/hfsa-acc-aha-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-raas-antagonists-in-covid-19, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020); Position statement of the ESC council on hypertension on ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020); Information for clinicians on therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html, Available at:- (Accessed 22 March 2020)",,,,"Elsevier Ltd",,,,,18714021,,,"32247212","English","Diabetes Metab.

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines. © 2020, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine.","Clinical practice guidelines; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Critical illness; SARS CoV-2","tocilizumab; vasoactive agent; Article; artificial ventilation; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; cytokine storm; health care cost; heart injury; hemodynamics; human; infection control; laboratory diagnosis; patient care; positive end expiratory pressure; practice guideline; respiratory failure; risk factor; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; systematic review (topic); virus transmission; Coronavirus infection; intensive care; intensive care unit; pandemic; practice guideline; sepsis; survivor; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sepsis; Survivors",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Liu, L., Zhong, N.S., Clinical characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med; Situation Update Worldwide, 4, , https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases, March 2020. 2020, March 4; Alhazzani, W., Lewis, K., Jaeschke, R., Rochwerg, B., Moller, M.H., Evans, L., Wilson, K.C., Akl, E.A., Conflicts of interest disclosure forms and management in critical care clinical practice guidelines (2018) Intensive Care Med, 44, pp. 1691-1698. , PID: 30264380; Vandvik, P.O., Alhazzani, W., Moller, M.H., Understanding conflicts of interest (2018) Intensive Care Med, 44, pp. 1738-1740. , PID: 30083991; Guyatt, G.H., Oxman, A.D., Kunz, R., Atkins, D., Brozek, J., Vist, G., Alderson, P., Schunemann, H.J., GRADE guidelines: 2.

In absence of any effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), remdesivir has been tried for a compassionate use in severe COVID-19. Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734″ AND “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” and retrieved all the article published in English language, that have reported the pharmacology and the clinical outcomes of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. Results: Initial compassionate use of remdesivir has shown a fairly good result, but difficult to quantify, in the absence of control arm. While the very first double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial conducted in Wuhan, did not find any significant benefit compared to the control, the preliminary result of another similar multi-country trial has shown a significant faster time to recovery but without any difference in mortality. Conclusions: Remdesivir has shown a mixed result in patients with COVID-19 with an acceptable side effect. However, jury is still out while awaiting the results from the forthcoming trials. © 2020 Diabetes India","Clinical outcome; COVID-19; Mortality; Remdesivir; SARS-Co-V-2","alanine aminotransferase; cefepime; chloroquine; glucose; hydroxychloroquine; hypertensive factor; liver enzyme; lopinavir plus ritonavir; placebo; remdesivir; vancomycin; abnormal laboratory result; acute kidney failure; acute respiratory failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral activity; Article; case study; China; clinical outcome; clinical pharmacology; clinical study; constipation; coronavirus disease 2019; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug contraindication; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug repositioning; drug safety; drug withdrawal; ecchymosis; equipoise; glucose blood level; headache; heart arrest; human; hypotension; in vitro study; in vivo study; kidney dysfunction; lactation; limb pain; liver dysfunction; loading drug dose; mortality; multiple organ failure; nausea; nonhuman; oxygen saturation; pediatric patient; phlebitis; pneumonia; preclinical study; pregnancy; priority journal; prothrombin time; randomized controlled trial (topic); rash; recommended drug dose; respiratory failure; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; side effect; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; urinary excretion; Wuhan",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; cefepime, 88040-23-7; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; vancomycin, 1404-90-6, 1404-93-9","gs 5734",,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID: NCT04280705","Meanwhile on April 29, 2020, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced an interim result of a randomized, controlled trial named ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) involving 1063 patients (NCT04280705) that started on Feb 21, 2020 and closed on April 19, 2020 for new enrollments. This study was conducted at 68 sites (47 in USA and 21 in Europe and Asia) and sponsored by NIAID, the part of the National Institutes of Health. Preliminary results indicate that the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared to 15 days for those who received placebo, thereby suggesting that patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p < 0.001). However, the survival benefit with remdesivir was not statistically significant compared to the control, since remdesivir group had a mortality rate of 8.0% compared to 11.6% for the placebo group (p = 0.059) [15].",,"Lo, M.K., Jordan, R., Arvey, A., GS-5734 and its parent nucleoside analog inhibit filo-, pneumo-, and paramyxoviruses (2017) Sci Rep, 7, p. 43395;

Employing combined therapy of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine has been proposed, in which Ma Xing Shi Gan Decoction (MXSGD) was recommended as a basic prescription and applied widely in the clinical treatment of COVID-19. We investigated the underlying mechanism of MXSGD in treating COVID-19 utilizing the approaches of integrating network pharmacology. A total of 97 active ingredients of MXSGD were screened out, and 169 targets were predicted. The protein-protein interaction network exhibited hub targets of MXSGD, such as Heat shock protein 90, RAC-alpha serine/ threonine-protein kinase, Transcription factor AP- 1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, Cellular tumor antigen p53, Vascular endothelial growth factor A, and Tumour necrosis factor. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the biological processes altered within the body after taking MXSGD were closely related to the regulation of such processes as the acute inflammatory response, chemokine production, vascular permeability, response to oxygen radicals, oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, T cell differentiation involved in the immune response, immunoglobulin secretion, and extracellular matrix disassembly. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the targets of MXSGD were significantly enriched in inflammation-related pathways, immunomodulation- related pathways, and viral infection-related pathways. The therapeutic mechanisms of MXSGD on COVID-19 may primarily involve the following effects: reducing inflammation, suppressing cytokine storm, protecting the pulmonary alveolar- capillary barrier, alleviating pulmonary edema, regulating the immune response, and decreasing fever. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

In addition to directly affecting population health, the economic impact of this social shock has begun to be palpable at the individual level. Situated in this context, this research note draws on data collected from Mainland China in March–April, 2020 to examine the individual-level economic toll of the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigate how individuals’ income (when surveyed) has changed relative to before the outbreak, and pay particular attention to the potentially unequal distribution of economic vulnerability based on structural (dis)advantages and COVID-19 related conditions. We show that education, family economic status, Communist Party membership, state-sector employment, and urban hukou—all long-standing status markers in China—mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on individuals’ income losses. In addition, people who live in families or regions that were hit harder by COVID-19 are more likely to experience income losses. Taken together, this study shows that the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates pre-existing social inequalities but also creates new forms of disparities. Therefore, instead of acting as a great equalizer, the pandemic may well magnify the social distribution of economic vulnerability. To alleviate inequality and aid post-pandemic recovery, public policies need to be oriented toward vulnerable and marginalized populations. © 2020 The Author(s)","China; COVID-19; Income; Inequality; Stratification",,,,,,"Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR: COVID-19, OV7-170372","Yue Qian and Wen Fan acknowledge funding support from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research through the Operating Grant: Canadian 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Rapid Research Funding Opportunity (Funding #: OV7-170372 ).

Currently, the World Health Organization has confirmed that COVID-19 is a global infectious disease pandemic. This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment methods of severe COVID-19 and puts forward some tentative ideas, aiming to provide some guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of severe COVID-19. © Copyright © 2020 Xie, Ma, Tang and Liu.","COVID-19; diagnosis; epidemiology; pathogenesis; treatment",,,,,,,"The authors thank the patients and all members of their families.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients'blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance""strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.",,"antivirus agent; COVID-19; antibiotic prophylaxis; artificial ventilation; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; critical illness; electrolyte balance; human; mental stress; nutritional support; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; virus pneumonia; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Antiviral Agents; China; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Nutritional Support; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiration, Artificial; Shock; Stress, Psychological; Water-Electrolyte Balance",,"Antiviral Agents; COVID-19",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10089292,,,"32096367","Chinese","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082147050

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. Methods: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. Results: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. Conclusions: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19. © 2020","BiP; COVID-19 spike; GRP78; Pep42; Protein-protein docking; Structural bioinformatics","cyclopeptide; glucose regulated protein 78; Pep42; unclassified drug; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; heat shock protein; molecular chaperone GRP78; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; amino acid sequence; Article; binding affinity; binding site; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; molecular docking; nonhuman; physical chemistry; protein binding; protein domain; protein protein interaction; receptor binding; SARS-related coronavirus; sequence alignment; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; substrate binding domain beta; virus cell interaction; virus spike; Betacoronavirus; binding site; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; human; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; protein tertiary structure; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Binding Sites; Coronavirus Infections; Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Domains; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus",,"Heat-Shock Proteins; molecular chaperone GRP78; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"Hui, D.S., I Azhar, E., Madani, T.A., Ntoumi, F., Kock, R., Dar, O., (2020) Int J Infect Dis, 91, pp. 264-266; Bogoch, I.I., Watts, A., Thomas-Bachli, A., Huber, C., Kraemer, M.U.G., Khan, K., Pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China: potential for international spread via commercial air travel (2020) J Travel Med; Surveillance case definitions for human infection with novel coronavirus ( nCoV): interim guidance v1, January 2020 (2020), World Health Organization; Laboratory testing of human suspected cases of novel coronavirus ( nCoV) infection: interim guidance, 10 January 2020 (2020), World Health Organization; Infection prevention and control during health care when novel coronavirus ( nCoV) infection is suspected: interim guidance, January 2020 (2020), World Health Organization; Parr, J., Pneumonia in China: lack of information raises concerns among Hong Kong health workers (2020), British Medical Journal Publishing Group; Yang, L., China confirms human-to-human transmission of coronavirus (2020); Elfiky, A.A., Mahdy, S.M., Elshemey, W.M., Quantitative structure-activity relationship and molecular docking revealed a potency of anti-hepatitis C virus drugs against human corona viruses (2017) J Med Virol, 89 (6), pp. 1040-1047; Chan, J.F., Lau, S.K., To, K.K., Cheng, V.C., Woo, P.C., Yuen, K.-Y., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: another zoonotic betacoronavirus causing SARS-like disease (2015) Clin Microbiol Rev, 28 (2), pp. 465-522; WHO.

The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress. © 2020 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

Early activity has concentrated on explaining the course of the disease, reporting critical incidents, and handling the ill. Currently, Vietnam, an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country that shares a long border with China, has successfully controlled COVID-19. In this article, we aimed to provide updated information regarding COVID-19 in Vietnam, from the first case to the current outbreak. We hope the information in this article will help the world understand more about the surveillance and prevention policies of Vietnam’s COVID-19.

Methods: A statewide multi-institutional collaborative for COVID-19 patients was utilized to obtain clinical data on the first 10 critically ill COVID-19 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Results: Of the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID-19, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men. Seven (70%) had comorbidities. The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset. None of the patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever ≥103°F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%). All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X-rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia. All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration. Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course. One patient (10%) died after 9 days on ECMO from multiorgan dysfunction. Conclusions: These preliminary multi-institutional data from a statewide collaborative offer insight into the clinical characteristics of the first 10 patients requiring ECMO for COVID-19 and their initial clinical course. Greater morbidity and mortality is likely to be seen in these critically ill patients with longer follow-up. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","cardiogenic shock; coronavirus; COVID-19; ECMO",,,,,,,,,"(2020) Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU); Yang, X., Yu, Y., Xu, J., Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study (2020) Lancet Respir Med, , https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30079-5; (2020) Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when COVID-19 disease is suspected: interim guidance; Ramanathan, K., Antognini, D., Combes, A., Planning and provision of ECMO services for severe ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases (2020) Lancet Respir Med, , https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30121-1; Grant, A.A., Lineen, E.B., Koerner, M., Vianna, R., Loebe, M., Ghodsizad, A., A time to heal: the EMPROVE protocol (2019) Artif Organs, 43 (3), pp. 217-221; MacLaren, G., Fisher, D., Brodie, D., Preparing for the most critically ill patients with COVID-19: the potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (2020) JAMA, 323 (13), pp. 1245-1246; Alshahrani, M.S., Sindi, A., Alshamsi, F., Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (2018) Ann Intensive Care, 8, p. 3; Davies, A., Jones, D., Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) acute respiratory distress syndrome JAMA, 2009 (302), pp. 1888-1895; (2020), ECLS registry report, overall outcomes; Sultan, I., Habertheuer, A., Wallen, T., The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator therapy in the setting of type A aortic dissection (2017) J Card Surg, 32 (12), pp. 822-825","Sultan, I.; Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of PittsburghUnited States; email: sultani@upmc.edu",,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,,,08860440,,JCASE,,"English","J.

A new treatment strategy, in addition to antiviral therapy alone, may be required to have a significant impact on clinical outcomes. Immunomodulatory therapy to downregulate cytokine shock may provide information on the treatment of COVID-19. Combined use of an immunomodulatory agent with an antiviral agent may give doctors more time to provide supportive therapy to patients with COVID-19.

Such challenges call attention to the importance of frameworks that can be applied to aid sales managers in understanding the impact of and responses to COVID-19. Leavitt's model of organizational change, and socio-technical systems theory, point to the importance of considering four inter-related social (i.e., human and structure) and technical (i.e., task and technology) variables when examining organizational change, and recognizing that change to one variable can be predicated upon and/or bring about change to other variables. We tailor Leavitt's model to the B2B sales context and recognize the potential for exogenous shocks such as COVID-19 to impact each variable. In doing so, we conduct a review of practitioner-oriented articles, interviews with key informants working for B2B organizations, and a webinar with sales professionals. These efforts lead to a rich discussion and set of considerations that can help B2B sales forces better understand and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Crisis management; Sales force change; Salespeople; Socio-technical systems theory",,,,,,,,,"Arli, D., Bauer, C., Palmatier, R.W., Relational selling: Past, present and future (2018) Industrial Marketing Management, 69, pp. 169-184; Bostrom, R.P., Heinen, J.S., MIS problems and failures: A socio-technical perspective.

We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19’s heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection’s damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin.

So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease. As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF- α) through different routes. Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19. © 2020 IMSS","Antibiotics; Coronavirus diseases 2019; Inflammation; SARS-CoV-2; Septic shock","Betacoronavirus; clinical trial; cohort analysis; Coronavirus infection; human; immunology; inflammation; isolation and purification; multicenter study; pandemic; pathology; retrospective study; septic shock; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inflammation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Shock, Septic",,,,,,,,"Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1054-1062; Cecconi, M., Evans, L., Levy, M., Sepsis and septic shock (2018) Lancet, 392, pp. 75-87; Hantoushzadeh, S., Anvari Aliabad, R., Norooznezhad, A.H., Antibiotics, Pregnancy, and Fetal Mental Illnesses: Where is the link?

The clinical picture of COVID-19 suggests a role of ACE2 blockade, rather than its overexpression, in causing the pathogenesis. ACE2 blockade results in increased angiotensin II activity with simultaneous hampering of functions of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Acute respiratory distress due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and shock reported in COVID-19 patients can be explained by imbalanced angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) activities. Failure of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections indicates the importance of simultaneous induction of angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis for correcting pathological conditions in COVID-19 through its anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and cardioprotective roles. MasR agonists have also shown organ protective effects in a number of animal studies. Unfortunately, these agonists have not been tested in clinical studies. Their evaluation in seriously ill COVID-19 patients is urgently warranted to reduce mortality due to infection. © 2020 The Author(s)","ACE2; Angiotensin II; Angiotensin-(1-7); COVID-19; Mas receptors","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin II; angiotensin[1-7]; mas receptor; receptor; unclassified drug; age; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; pathogenesis; sex difference; Short Survey",,"angiotensin II, 11128-99-7, 68521-88-0; angiotensin[1-7], 39386-80-6",,,,,,"Anguiano, L., Riera, M., Pascual, J., Valdivielso, J.M., Barrios, C., Betriu, A., Circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity in patients with chronic kidney disease without previous history of cardiovascular disease (2015) Nephrol Dial Transplant, 30, pp. 1176-1185; Bullock, G.R., Steyaert, I., Bilbe, G., Carey, R.M., Kips, J., De Paepe, B., Distribution of type-1 and type-2 angiotensin receptors in the normal human lung and in lungs from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2001) Histochem Cell Biol, 115, pp. 117-124; Caly, L., Druce, J.D., Catton, M.G., Jans, D.A., Wagstaff, K.M., The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (2020) Antiviral Res; Cao, B., Wang, Y., Wen, D., Liu, W., Wang, J., Fan, G., A Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1787-1799; da Silveira, K.D., Coelho, F.M., Vieira, A.T., Sachs, D., Barroso, L.C., Costa, V.V., Anti-inflammatory effects of the activation of the angiotensin-(1-7) receptor, MAS, in experimental models of arthritis (2010) J Immunol, 185, pp. 5569-5576; Dikalov, S.I., Nazarewicz, R.R., Angiotensin II-induced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species: potential mechanisms and relevance for cardiovascular disease (2013) Antioxid Redox Signal, 19, pp. 1085-1094; Drugs, I., (2020), https://drugs.ncats.io/substance/IJ3FUK8MOF, ANGIOTENSIN 1-7 (IJ3FUK8MOF).

On March 25, 2020, a total of 375,498 cases had been confirmed globally with 2,201 cases in Brazil, showing the urgency of reacting to this international public health emergency. While in most cases, mild symptoms are observed, in some cases the infection leads to serious pulmonary disease. As a result, the possible consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak for pregnant women and its potential effects on the management of assisted reproductive treatments, demand attention. In this review, we summarize the latest research progress related to COVID-19 epidemiology and the reported data of pregnant women, and discuss the current evidence of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy and its potential consequences for assisted reproductive treatments. Reported data suggest that symptoms in pregnant women are similar to those in other people, and that there is no evidence for higher maternal or fetal risks. However, con-sidering the initial data and lack of comprehensive knowledge on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 during preg-nancy, human reproduction societies have recommended postponing the embryo transfers and do not initiate new treatment cycles. New evidence must be considered care-fully in order to adjust these recommendations accordingly at any time and to guide assisted reproductive treatments. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Reproducao Assistida.

The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected. To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill. While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use. This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare. © 2020 The Author(s).","Adjunctive treatment;

COVID-19 creates a unique “income shock” that is expected to increase the prevalence of household food insecurity. This food insecurity can be measured by utilizing the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). More fundamentally, COVID-19 heightens household concern about the capacity of the Canadian food system to ensure food availability. Despite surges in demand and supply chain disruptions, we currently do not observe broad, rapid appreciation in food prices. This suggests that there is an adequate supply of food for the near term. There is less certainty over intermediate and longer time periods because so many factors are in flux, particularly the rate of increases in sicknesses and deaths across the country and globally. Data on these health factors and elements of the food supply chain are needed to predict beyond a short time frame. In this regard, we discuss three ongoing considerations—ease of capital flows, international exchange, and maintaining transportation—that will help ensure food availability in the longer run. © 2020 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","COVID-19; food security",,,,,,,,,"Breen, K., (2020) Coronavirus: 500,000 Canadians have filed for EI this week, , https://globalnews.ca/news/6707529/coronavirus-500000-canadians-employment-insurance/, March 20)., Global News, Retrieved from; Deaton, B.J., Scholz, A., Lipka, B., An empirical assessment of food security on First Nations in Canada (2019) Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics, 2019, pp. 5-19; (2020) Predicting the post-pandemic recovery, , https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-dashboard.html, April 6)., Deloitte Economic-Insights, Retrieved from; (2018) National Report of the First Nations Regional Health Survey Phase 3: Vol 2, , Ottawa FNIGC; Fraser, E., (2020) The COVID-19 pandemic and Canada's food system, , https://ipolitics.ca/2020/03/20/the-covid-19-pandemic-and-canadas-food-system/, March 20)., iPolitics, Retrieved from; Glauber, J., Laborde, D., Martin, W., Vos, R., (2020) COVID-19: Trade restrictions are worst possible response to safeguard food security, , https://www.ifpri.org/blog/covid-19-trade-restrictions-are-worst-possible-response-safeguard-food-security, March 27)., IFPRI Blog Issue Post, Retrieved from; Sachs, G., (2020) US Daily: A sudden stop for the US economy, , https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/us-daily-20-mar-2020/report.pdf, March 20)., Goldman Sachs Economics Research, Retrieved from; (2020) Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response, , https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.html#individuals, Retrieved from; Grant, T., (2020) Crops in peril as temporary foreign workers yet to arrive [print article], , https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-food-supply-at-risk-as-pandemic-tightens-borders-to-farm/?symbol=print-msg, April 2)., The Globe and Mail, Retrieved from; Hughes, G., (2020) Ottawa to exempt temporary foreign workers from some COVID-19 travel rules, , https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ottawa-to-exempt-temporary-foreign-workers-from-some-COVID-19-travel-3/, March 20)., The Globe and Mail, Retrieved from; Inman, P., (2020) A hundred years on, will there be another Great Depression?, , https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response, March 5)., The Guardian, Retrieved from; Naylor, J., Deaton, B.J., Ker, A., Assessing the effect of food retail subsidies on the price of food in remote Indigenous communities: A case study of nutrition North Canada, , (Forthcoming)., Food Policy; (2007) Section 1: Food in Canada, , https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/16-201-x/2009000/part-partie1-eng.htm, [website].

However, the imaging risk factors for poor clinical outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the imaging characteristics and risk factors associated with adverse composite endpoints in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 24 designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between 10 January and 18 February 2020. Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records. Patients aged < 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded. The composite endpoints were admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure occurrence, or shock during hospitalization. The volume, density, and location of lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, were quantitatively analyzed in each patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors among age and CT parameters associated with the composite endpoints. Results: In this study, 625 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled; among them, 179 patients without an initial CT at admission and 25 patients aged < 18 years old were excluded and 421 patients were included in analysis. The median age was 48.0 years and the male proportion was 53% (224/421). During the follow-up period, 64 (15%) patients had a composite endpoint. There was an association of older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.06; P = 0.003), larger consolidation lesions in the upper lung (Right: OR, 1.13; 95%CI: 1.03-1.25, P =0.01; Left: OR,1.15; 95%CI: 1.01-1.32; P = 0.04) with increased odds of adverse endpoints. Conclusion: There was an association of older age and larger consolidation in upper lungs on admission with higher odds of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. © The author(s).","COVID-19 pneumonia; CT scan; outcome; risk factor","adult; age; aged; algorithm; Betacoronavirus; China; clinical trial; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; female; human; image processing; lung; male; middle aged; multicenter study; pandemic; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Deep Learning; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,18387640,,,"32373237","English","Theranostics",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084329186

While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure, with a 3–6% mortality. A plethora of treatments has been or is being assessed, but to date, none has been proven effective. Management is mainly symptomatic, with organ support for the critically ill. Several reports, mainly case series, from across the world have concluded that patients with malignancy appear more susceptible to severe infection and mortality from COVID-19. This could be attributed to immunosuppression, co-existing medical conditions and underlying pulmonary compromise which is often the case in lung malignancy. Patients with haematological cancer and those who are receiving active chemotherapy treatment may be at greatest risk due to increased immunosuppression. This pandemic tested the resilience of worldwide health-care systems in an unprecedented manner. It has forced oncologists to rethink the entire diagnostic and therapeutic process, based on the local prevalence and impact of COVID-19. In this review we will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on patients affected by cancer, their diagnosis and management, as well as the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress symptoms and currently investigated treatment approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Covid-19; Immunotherapy; Mortality; NSCLC","angiotensin converting enzyme 2; azithromycin; canakinumab; chloroquine; corticosteroid; gamma interferon; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; Janus kinase 1; Janus kinase 2; lopinavir plus ritonavir; macrophage inflammatory protein; monocyte chemotactic protein; ruxolitinib; siltuximab; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; adult respiratory distress syndrome; biological therapy; blood transfusion; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; health care management; herd immunity; human; malignant neoplasm; pandemic; pathophysiology; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); protein blood level; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; canakinumab, 402710-25-2, 402710-27-4, 914613-48-2; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; gamma interferon, 82115-62-6; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; interleukin 2, 85898-30-2; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; siltuximab, 541502-14-1; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Al-Qahtani, A.A., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2): emergence, history, basic and clinical aspects (2020) Saudi J Biol Sci; (2019), WHO.

SARS-CoV-2 causes viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and major complications, including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and shock mainly in elderly patients. Furthermore, patients with existing cardiovascular comorbidities, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease, have a worse clinical outcome following contraction of the viral illness. A striking feature of COVID-19 pandemics is the high incidence of fatalities in advanced aged patients: this might be due to the prevalence of frailty and cardiovascular disease increase with age due to endothelial dysfunction and loss of endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms. Although experimental evidence on this topic is still at its infancy, the aim of this position paper is to hypothesize and discuss more suggestive cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby SARS-CoV-2 may lead to detrimental consequences to the cardiovascular system. We will focus on aging, cytokine storm, NLRP3/inflammasome, hypoxemia, and air pollution, which is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor associated with rapid urbanization and globalization. We will finally discuss the impact of clinically available CV drugs on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. Understanding the role played by SARS-CoV2 on the CV system is indeed mandatory to get further insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and to design a therapeutic strategy of cardio-protection for frail patients. © 2020, American Aging Association.","Acute myocardial injury; Aging; Cardiovascular system; COVID-19; Frailty; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,"Horizon 2020: N. 828984

A significant number of elderly patients require hospitalization and develop serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary impact (8 weeks) of CoVID-19, focusing on proximal femur fractures, analyzing data and results compared to the same period of 2019. Materials and methods: From February 22nd to April 18th, 2020 we surgically treated 121 proximal femur fractures (61 in Piacenza; 60 in Parma, 16 male, 44 female, mean age 81.1). In the same period of 2019, we treated 169 proximal femur fractures (90 in Piacenza, 33 male, 57 female, mean age 81.9; 79 in Parma, 29 males, 50 female, mean age 80.2). We had 21/61 (34.4%) patients resulted positive for COVID-19 and 11/61 in Parma (18.3%), based on nasal-pharyngeal swab, chest CT scan and/or lung US findings. Results: The incidence of proximal femur fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread in Piacenza and Parma. Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery. Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive. In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive. Conclusion: In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old. Even if preliminary, our study shows a significant increase in death in elderly patients surgically treated for proximal femur fractures, particularly in the Piacenza Hospital. © Mattioli 1885.","Coronavirus; CoVID-19; Elderly patient; Italian outbreak; Proximal femur fracture","adult; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; cardiopulmonary insufficiency; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; dyspnea; emergency ward; fatigue; female; femur intertrochanteric fracture; fever; geriatric patient; heart arrest; hemiarthroplasty; hospitalization; human; incidence; intramedullary nailing; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; multiple organ failure; nose obstruction; proximal femur fracture; retrospective study; revision arthroplasty; septic shock; sore throat; throat culture; total hip replacement; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; emergency health service; femur fracture; Italy; orthopedics; pandemic; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Femoral Fractures; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,,,,,,,"Lu, H., Oubreak of pneumonia of unkwown etiology in Wuhan China: The mistery and the miracle (2020) J Med Virol, , Jan 16; Carlos, Novel Wuhan (2019 nCoV) coronavirus (2020) Am J Resp Crit Care Med, 201; Lai, C.-C., Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challenges (2020) Int J of Antimic Agents, 20 (7), p. 4; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, p. 497; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , Feb 28, Epub ahead of print; Jin, X., Lian, J., Hu, J., Epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of 74 cases of coronavirus-infected disease 2019 (COVID-19) with gastrointestinal symptoms (2020) Gut, , Mar 24, Epub ahead of print; Poggiali, E., Ramos, P.M., Bastoni, D., Vercelli, A., Magnacavallo, A., Abdominal pain: A real challenge in novel COVID-19 infection (2020) EJCRIM, 7; (2020) Coronavirus Disease 2019: Resources, , https://www.entnet.org/content/coronavirus-disease2019-resources, accessed 23 March; Giacomelli, A., Pezzati, L., Conti, F., Self-reported olfactory and taste disorders in SARS-CoV-2 patients: A crosssectional study (2020) Clin Infect Dis, , Mar 26, Epub ahead of print; (2020) Novel Coronavirus (2019-Ncov): Situation Report, 2. , https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/330761, 22 January, accessed 2 April 2020; Cao, B., Wang, Y., Wen, D., Liu, W., Wang, J., Fan, G., A trial of lopinavir-ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med, , Mar 18; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395 (10223), pp. 497-506; Palmieri, L., Andrianou, X., Barbariol, P., (2020) Caratteristiche Dei Pazienti Deceduti Positivi all’infezione Da Sars-Cov-2 in Italia, , EpiCentro - Istituto Superiore di Sanità, April 23; Muller, M.E., Nazarian, S., Koch, P., Schatzker, J., (1990) The Comprehensive Classification of Fractures of Long Bones Springer, , Berlin; Garden, R.S., Low-angle fixation in fractures of the femoral neck (1961) J Bone Joint Surg Br, 43, pp. 647-663; Pauwels, F., (1935) Der Schenkelhalsbruch, Ein Mechanisches Problem, , Stuttgart: F.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence for the existence of elevated plasmin(ogen) in COVID-19 patients with these comorbid conditions. Plasmin, and other proteases, may cleave a newly inserted furin site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2, extracellularly, which increases its infectivity and virulence. Hyperfibrinolysis associated with plasmin leads to elevated D-dimer in severe patients. The plasmin(ogen) system may prove a promising therapeutic target for combating COVID-19. © 2020 the American Physiological Society.","Comorbidity; COVID-19; Fibrinolysis; Plasmin(ogen); SARS-CoV-2","furin; plasmin; plasminogen; viral protein; vitronectin; plasmin; plasminogen; acidosis; acute kidney failure; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; bleeding; blood clotting disorder; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; diabetes mellitus; fibrinolysis; heart failure; heart injury; human; hypoproteinemia; infection risk; infection sensitivity; kidney failure; liver failure; pathogenicity; priority journal; protein degradation; respiratory failure; secondary infection; sepsis; septic shock; virus cell interaction; virus load; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; disease predisposition; host pathogen interaction; metabolism; mortality; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; risk factor; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Susceptibility; Fibrinolysin; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Pandemics; Plasminogen; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Risk Factors",,"furin; plasmin, 9001-90-5, 9004-09-5; plasminogen, 9001-91-6; Fibrinolysin; Plasminogen",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: HL87017","This study was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants HL87017 (to H.-L.

This study investigates the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Zhejiang Province who did or did not have a history of Wuhan exposure. Methods: We collected data from medical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province from Jan. 17 to Feb. 7, 2020 and analyzed epidemiological, clinical, and treatment data of those with and without recorded recent exposure in Wuhan. Results: Patients in the control group were older than those in the exposure group ((48.19±16.13) years vs. (43.47±13.12) years, P<0.001), and more were over 65 years old (15.95% control vs. 5.60% exposure, P<0.001). The rate of clustered onset was also significantly higher in the control group than in the exposure group (31.39% vs. 18.66%, P<0.001). The symptom of a sore throat in patients in the exposure group was significantly higher than that in the control group (17.30% vs. 10.89%, P=0.01); however, headache in the exposure group was significantly lower than that in the control group (6.87% vs. 12.15%, P=0.015). More patients in the exposure group had a significantly lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than those in the control group. There was no significant difference in any degree of COVID-19 including mild, severe, and critical between the two groups. Conclusions: From the perspective of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, there was no significant difference between COVID-19 patients with and without Wuhan exposure history. © 2020, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); R512.99; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Wuhan; Zhejiang Province","albumin; alpha interferon; arbidol; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatine kinase; creatinine; hemoglobin; lactate dehydrogenase; lopinavir plus ritonavir; potassium; sodium; urea; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; albumin blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; artificial ventilation; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; China; clinical feature; clinical study; comparative study; continuous renal replacement therapy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; dyspnea; epidemiological data; fatigue; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hemoglobin blood level; hemoptysis; human; intermittent mandatory ventilation; international normalized ratio; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; leukocyte count; liver disease; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; myalgia; neutrophil count; nose obstruction; platelet count; population exposure; potassium blood level; priority journal; retrospective study; septic shock; sodium blood level; sore throat; urea nitrogen blood level; adolescent; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; case control study; child; Coronavirus infection; infant; middle aged; newborn; pandemic; pathophysiology; preschool child; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Betacoronavirus; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; potassium, 7440-09-7; sodium, 7440-23-5; urea, 57-13-6; Aspartate Aminotransferases; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase",,,"National Major Science and Technology Projects of China: 2017ZX10202202

Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe. Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Coronavirus;

This virus has a high infectivity rate and has impacted a significant chunk of the population worldwide. The spectrum of disease ranges from mild to severe with respiratory system being the most commonly affected. Cardiovascular system often gets involved in later stages of the disease with acute cardiac injury, heart failure and arrhythmias being the common complications. In addition, the presence of cardiovascular co-morbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease in these patients are often associated with poor prognosis. It is still not clear regarding the exact mechanism explaining cardiovascular system involvement in COVID-19. Multiple theories have been put forward however, more robust studies are required to fully elucidate the “heart and virus” link. The disease has already made its presence felt on the global stage and its impact in the developing countries is mer going to be profound. These nations not only have a poorly developed healthcare system but there is also a huge burden of cardiovascular diseases. As a result, COVID-19 would adversely impact the already overburdened healthcare network leading to impaired cardiovascular care delivery especially for acute coronary syndrome and heart failure patients. © The Author(s), 2020","Acute respiratory distress syndrome;

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. Objectives: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords “COVID 19,” “SARS-CoV-2,” and “treatment.” All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. Discussion: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. Conclusion: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","COVID 19; Favipiravir; Hydroxychloroquine; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"Guo, Y.R., Cao, Q.D., Hong, Z.S., The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak - an update on the status (2020) Mil Med Res, 7 (1), p. 11; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Information for clinicians on therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html;, (Accessed 27 March 2020); Fang, L., Karakiulakis, G., Roth, M., Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?

Herein we give an overview of the therapeutic options for treating or preventing these disease states. In recent years, CytoSorb-haemoperfusion to remove cytokines has shown promising results in the treatment of septic shock. Inhalational nitric oxide (iNO), inhalational epoprostenol and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are options in severe hypoxemia that is unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.

What would have been a standard ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with timely and successful stenting of a dominant right coronary artery occlusion, became a much more dangerous postinfarction ventricular septal defect; all because of a 2-day delay in seeking medical attention by an unsuspecting patient. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coronary artery disease; COVID-19; postinfarction ventricular septal defect","adult; angina pectoris; Article; cardiogenic shock; case report; clinical article; coronavirus disease 2019; echocardiography; electrocardiography; heart catheterization; heart surgery; heart ventricle septum defect; help seeking behavior; hospital discharge; human; hypotension; lung congestion; male; middle aged; pandemic; percutaneous coronary intervention; practice guideline; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; systolic heart murmur; tachycardia; therapy delay; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; United States",,,,,,,,"Bernstein, L., Sellers, F.S., Patients with heart attacks, strokes and even appendicitis vanish from hospitals (2020) The Washington Post, , https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/patients-with-heart-attacks-strokes-and-even-appendicitis-vanish-from-hospitals/2020/04/19/9ca3ef24-7eb4-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html, Accessed 19 April 2020; Metzler, B., Siostrzonek, P., Binder, R.K., Bauer, A., Reinstadler, S.J., Decline of acute coronary syndrome admissions in Austria since the outbreak of COVID-19: the pandemic response causes cardiac collateral damage (2020) Eur Heart J, , https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa314; Garcia, S., Albaghdadi, M.S., Meraj, P.M., Reduction in ST-segment elevation cardiac catheterization laboratory activations in the United States during COVID-19 pandemic (2020) J Amer Coll Cardiol, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.011","Masroor, S.; Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life SciencesUnited States; email: saqib.masroor@utoledo.edu",,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",,,,,08860440,,JCASE,"32419177","English","J.

Patients requiring hospitalization frequently suffer from respiratory failure of different severities. Aim: The aim of this guideline is the treatment of patients with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) in hospital; in particular, it addresses the treatment of respiratory failure treated in general Internal Medical- and Pulmonary Medical wards. Results: Elderly patients and patients with chronic disease are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Target oxygen saturation should be between 92% and 96% in patients without chronic lung diseases. Treatment with >5 L oxygen/min should be in close collaboration with intensive care colleagues and >15 l/min preferably in intensive care units. High-flow nasal canula (HFNC) and long-term Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are recommended for patients not responding to conventional oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is only recommended for selected patients, such as those with a ceiling of treatment or patients presenting with hypercapnic failure. With the use of humidification protective equipment as FFP2-3 masks should be used. Nebulized medication should be avoided, and spacers should be used instead. Conclusion: Respiratory failure is frequently the cause of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 and should be monitored closely. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Therefore, fluid administration in patients with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) should be properly guided. Choice of an index to guide fluid management during a pandemic with mass patient admissions carries an additional challenge due to the relatively limited resources. An ideal test for assessment of fluid responsiveness during this pandemic should be accurate in ARDS patients, economic, easy to interpret by junior staff, valid in patients in the prone position and performed with minimal contact with the patient to avoid spread of infection. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS are divided into two phenotypes (L phenotype and H phenotype) according to their lung compliance. Selection of the proper index for fluid responsiveness varies according to the patient phenotype. Heart–lung interaction methods can be used only in patients with L phenotype ARDS. Real-time measures, such a pulse pressure variation, are more appropriate for use during this pandemic compared to ultrasound-derived measures, because contamination of the ultrasound machine can spread infection. Preload challenge tests are suitable for use in all COVID-19 patients. Passive leg raising test is relatively better than mini-fluid challenge test, because it can be repeated without overloading the patient with fluids. Trendelenburg maneuver is a suitable alternative to the passive leg raising test in patients with prone position. If a cardiac output monitor was not available, the response to the passive leg raising test could be traced by measurement of the pulse pressure or the perfusion index. Preload modifying maneuvers, such as tidal volume challenge, can also be used in COVID-19 patients, especially if the patient was in the gray zone of other dynamic tests. However, the preload modifying maneuvers were not extensively evaluated outside the operating room. Selection of the proper test would vary according to the level of healthcare in the country and the load of admissions which might be overwhelming. Evaluation of the volume status should be comprehensive; therefore, the presence of signs of volume overload such as lower limb edema, lung edema, and severe hypoxemia should be considered beside the usual indices for fluid responsiveness. © 2020, Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists.","COVID-19; Fluid responsiveness; Heart–lung interaction; Pandemic; Passive leg raising test; Septic shock",,,,,,,,,"Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Zhu, F., Liu, X., Zhang, J., Wang, B., Peng, Z., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA., 323, pp. 1061-1069. , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031570, COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXlvVSqtbY%3D; Alhazzani, W., Møller, M.H., Arabi, Y.M., Loeb, M., Gong, M.N., Fan, E., Oczkowski, S., Rhodes, A., Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) Intensive Care Med., 46, pp. 854-887; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Cao, B., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet., 395, pp. 497-506. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhs1Kqu7c%3D; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Qiu, Y., Zhang, L., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet [Internet]., 395, pp. 507-513; Hasanin, A., Fluid responsiveness in acute circulatory failure (2015) J Intensive Care [Internet], 3, p. 50. , https://www.jintensivecare.com/content/3/1/50, (cited 1 Dec 2015); Marik, P.E., Byrne, L., van Haren, F., Fluid resuscitation in sepsis: the great 30 mL per kg hoax (2020) Journal of Thoracic Disease, 12 (S1), pp. S37-S47. , https://jtd.amegroups.com/article/view/34911/html; Ji, Y., Ma, Z., Peppelenbosch, M.P., Pan, Q., Potential association between COVID-19 mortality and health-care resource availability (2020) Lancet Glob Health [Internet], 8; Xie, J., Tong, Z., Guan, X., Du, B., Qiu, H., Slutsky, A.S., Critical care crisis and some recommendations during the COVID-19 epidemic in China (2020) Intensive Care Med [Internet], 46, pp. 837-840; Gattinoni, L., Chiumello, D., Caironi, P., Busana, M., Romitti, F., Brazzi, L., Camporota, L., COVID-19 pneumonia: different respiratory treatment for different phenotypes?

The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures. © 2020 European Society of Cardiology.","ACS; COVID-19; NSTEMI; PCI; STEMI","biological marker; troponin; acute coronary syndrome; Article; blood clot lysis; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular risk; clinical feature; conservative treatment; coronary angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease burden; emergency care; evidence based medicine; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart infarction; heart muscle injury; high risk patient; human; invasive procedure; low risk patient; non st segment elevation acute coronary syndrome; pandemic; priority journal; prognosis; revascularization; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; acute coronary syndrome; cardiology; Coronavirus infection; infection control; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; pandemic; practice guideline; procedures; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; virology; virus pneumonia; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Cardiology; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Infection Control; Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction",,,,,,,,"Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Ren, R., Feng, Z., Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1199-1207; Stefanini, G.G., Azzolini, E., Condorelli, G., Critical organizational issues for cardiologists in the COVID-19 outbreak: A frontline experience from Milan, Italy (2020) Circulation; Driggin, E., Madhavan, M.V., Bikdeli, B., Chuich, T., Laracy, J., Bondi-Zoccai, G., Brown, T.S., Parikh, S.A., Cardiovascular considerations for patients, health care workers, and health systems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (2020) J Am Coll Cardiol; Neumann, F.J., Sousa-Uva, M., Ahlsson, A., Alfonso, F., Banning, A.P., Benedetto, U., Byrne, R.A., Zembala, M.O., 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization (2019) Eur Heart J, 40, pp. 87-165. , ESC Scientific Document Group; Thygesen, K., Alpert, J.S., Jaffe, A.S., Chaitman, B.R., Bax, J.J., Morrow, D.A., White, H.D., Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) (2019) Eur Heart J, 40, pp. 237-269. , ESC Scientific Document Group; Chapman, A.R., Adamson, P.D., Shah, A.S.V., Anand, A., Strachan, F.E., Ferry, A.V., Ken Lee, K., Mills, N.L., High-STEACS Investigators.

The document reviews the measures put in place by the Italian Government and European Institutions such as the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to deal with this health crisis and subsequent severe economic recession, with particular reference to sources and uses of resources. The use of new budgetary financial spaces in deficit entails greater attention to the assessment of interventions and makes it necessary to keep expenditure under strict control. At the same time, the remodeling of expenditure within its aggregates, public investment in innovation, and the removal of administrative obstacles can strengthen the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the extraordinary needs deriving from the spread of Covid-19 and its resilience to future health shocks.

As governments grapple with their responses to the virus, more than half the world’s countries have closed their schools and severely limited almost all forms of public life. This will have a profound impact on children, both now and in the decade to come. As many countries start to send children back to school, a question arises: who should go back to school first? This Viewpoint addresses that question in the context of a middle-income country, South Africa. Based on a review of much of the evidence available at the time of publication, it concludes that the youngest children are least susceptible to harm from COVID-19, are less likely to spread the virus than adults, and also have the most to lose by being out of school. Hence, they should be the ones to return to school first. © 2020, UNESCO IBE.","Age; Children; COVID-19; Education policy; Schooling; South Africa",,,,,,,,,"Bassier, I., Budlender, J., Leibbrandt, M., Zizzamia, R., Ranchhod, V., South Africa can—and should—top up child support grants to avoid a humanitarian crisis The Conversation., , https://theconversation.com/south-africa-can-and-should-top-up-child-support-grants-to-avoid-a-humanitarian-crisis-135222; News, B.B.C., (2020) Coronavirus: Switzerland Says Young Children Can Hug Grandparents, , https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52470838; Bi, Q., Wu, Y., Mei, S., Ye, C., Zou, X., Zhang, Z., Epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in 391 cases and 1286 of their close contacts in Shenzhen: A retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet Infectious Diseases, , https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30287-5, 27 April; Age, and state (COVID-19) (2020) Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease by Sex, , https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm; Crawley, E., Loades, M., Feder, G., Wider collateral damage to children in the UK because of the social distancing measures designed to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in adults (2020) BMJ Paediatrics Open.; Danis, K., Epaulard, O., Bénet, T., Cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the French Alps, 2020 (2020) Clinical Infectious Diseases; (2020) Basic Education and SABC Launch Coronavirus COVID-19 TV and Radio Curriculum Support Programmes for Learners, , https://www.gov.za/speeches/basic-education-and-sabc%C2%A0launch%C2%A0coronavirus-covid-19-tv-and-radio-curriculum-support; (2020) An Evidence Summary of Paediatric COVID-19 Literature, , https://dontforgetthebubbles.com/evidence-summary-paediatric-covid-19-literature/; Drosten, C., An analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral load by patient age (2020) Charite Research Network Zoonotic Infectious Diseases., , https://zoonosen.charite.de/fileadmin/user_upload/microsites/m_cc05/virologie-ccm/dateien_upload/Weitere_Dateien/analysis-of-SARS-CoV-2-viral-load-by-patient-age.pdf; Duncan-Williams, K., South Africa’s digital divide detrimental to the youth (2020) Mail & Guardian, , https://mg.co.za/article/2020-04-19-south-africas-digital-divide-detrimental-to-the-youth/; Gudbjartsson, D.F., Helgason, A., Jonsson, H., Magnusson, O.T., Melsted, P., Norddahl, G.L., Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population (2020) New England Journal of Medicine; Gustafsson, M., (2020) Basic education: The coronavirus, , Department of Basic Education, Pretoria; Short communication: Submitted to Osong public health and research perspectives coronavirus disease-19 (2020) The First 7,755 Cases in the Republic of Korea., , https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.20036368v1.full.pdf; Jing, Q.L., Liu, M.J., Yuan, J., Zhang, Z.B., Zhang, A.R., Dean, N.E., .

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males. Conclusion: Based on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).","ARDS; COVID-19; HMGB1; Influenza; Pathogenesis; Pneumonia; RAGE; SARS-CoV-2; Therapy; TLR4","advanced glycation end product receptor; chloroquine; dexmedetomidine; glycyrrhizic acid; haptoglobin; heparin; heparinoid; high mobility group B1 protein; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; inflammasome; ketamine; resveratrol; thrombomodulin; toll like receptor 4; high mobility group B1 protein; HMGB1 protein, human; TLR4 protein, human; toll like receptor 4; virus RNA; bacterial pneumonia; blood clotting disorder; cell death; cell stress; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; endocytosis; endothelium cell; gene targeting; human; influenza; injury; lung endothelium; nonhuman; pathogenesis; pneumonia; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; protein targeting; reperfusion injury; respiratory syncytial virus infection; Review; sepsis; shock; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; inflammation; lung; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; pandemic; pathophysiology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; HMGB1 Protein; Humans; Inflammation; Lung; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Toll-Like Receptor 4",,"advanced glycation end product receptor, 198785-73-8, 247590-69-8; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; dexmedetomidine, 113775-47-6; glycyrrhizic acid, 1405-86-3; haptoglobin, 9087-69-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; ketamine, 1867-66-9, 6740-88-1, 81771-21-3; resveratrol, 501-36-0; thrombomodulin, 112049-68-0; toll like receptor 4, 203811-83-0; HMGB1 Protein; HMGB1 protein, human; RNA, Viral; TLR4 protein, human; Toll-Like Receptor 4",,,,,,"Abeyama, K., Stern, D.M., Ito, Y., Kawahara, K., Yoshimoto, Y., Tanaka, M., The N-terminal domain of thrombomodulin sequesters high-mobility group-B1 protein, a novel antiinflammatory mechanism (2005) J Clin Invest, 115 (5), pp. 1267-1274. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXktFSkt7Y%3D 15841214 1077171; Andersson, U., Tracey, K.J., HMGB1 is a therapeutic target for sterile inflammation and infection (2011) Annu Rev Immunol, 29, pp. 139-162. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3MXltlKns78%3D 21219181 4536551; Andersson, U., Tracey, K.J., Neural reflexes in inflammation and immunity (2012) J Exp Med, 209 (6), pp. 1057-1068. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC38XoslSiurc%3D 22665702 3371736; Andersson, U., Wang, H., Palmblad, K., Aveberger, A.C., Bloom, O., Erlandsson-Harris, H., High mobility group 1 protein (HMG-1) stimulates proinflammatory cytokine synthesis in human monocytes (2000) J Exp Med, 192 (4), pp. 565-570. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3cXlvFemsL0%3D 10952726 2193240; Andersson, U., Yang, H., Harris, H., High-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) operates as an alarmin outside as well as inside cells (2018) Semin Immunol, 38, pp. 40-48. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC1cXkt1Knt7c%3D 29530410 29530410; Andersson, U., Yang, H., Harris, H., Extracellular HMGB1 as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases (2018) Expert Opin Ther Targets, 22 (3), pp. 263-277. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC1cXivFSnu7w%3D 29447008 29447008; Angus, D.C., Yang, L., Kong, L., Kellum, J.A., Delude, R.L., Tracey, K.J., Circulating high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) concentrations are elevated in both uncomplicated pneumonia and pneumonia with severe sepsis (2007) Crit Care Med, 35 (4), pp. 1061-1067. , 17334246 17334246; Bierhaus, A., Humpert, P.M., Morcos, M., Wendt, T., Chavakis, T., Arnold, B., Understanding RAGE, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (2005) J Mol Med (Berl), 83 (11), pp. 876-886. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD2MXht1SksbjP; Bonaldi, T., Talamo, F., Scaffidi, P., Ferrera, D., Porto, A., Bachi, A., Monocytic cells hyperacetylate chromatin protein HMGB1 to redirect it towards secretion (2003) Embo J, 22 (20), pp. 5551-5560. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXot1Crtrc%3D 14532127 213771; Bonaz, B., Sinniger, V., Hoffmann, D., Clarencon, D., Mathieu, N., Dantzer, C., Chronic vagus nerve stimulation in Crohn's disease: A 6-month follow-up pilot study (2016) Neurogastroenterology Motility, 28 (6), pp. 948-953. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC28Xot1Oksrw%3D 26920654; Brett, J., Schmidt, A.M., Yan, S.D., Zou, Y.S., Weidman, E., Pinsky, D., Survey of the distribution of a newly characterized receptor for advanced glycation end products in tissues (1993) Am J Pathol, 143 (6), pp. 1699-1712. , 1:CAS:528:DyaK2cXisVSqtrw%3D 8256857 1887265; Cinatl, J., Morgenstern, B., Bauer, G., Chandra, P., Rabenau, H., Doerr, H.W., Glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots, and replication of SARS-associated coronavirus (2003) Lancet (London, England), 361 (9374), pp. 2045-2046. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BD3sXksF2hu78%3D; Consolim-Colombo, F.M., Sangaleti, C.T., Costa, F.O., Morais, T.L., Lopes, H.F., Motta, J.M., Galantamine alleviates inflammation and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome in a randomized trial.

Compounding on this state of affairs is their inherent inefficiency to spend even that meager amount on the welfare of the patients, improving service delivery, motivating their workforce and making their health systems responsive to the needs of the people they serve. With weak fiscal base and inelasticity in budget spending, when these countries face a catastrophe like COVID-19, there is a whole situation of havoc and lack of finances emerges as the biggest issue in such crises. Pakistan has been no exception to this kind of situation. Government funds allocated to other public sector development schemes are diverted to deal with the health emergency. Hence, the result is an overall socioeconomic shock that a country has to face. Amid such crises, other international commitments also face a state of uncertainty. With the changing disease patterns all over the world, the public financial management system for health sector needs to be revisited to devise a more sustainable and resilient mechanism not only to absorb shocks like COVID-19 but also to meet the international health commitments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","COVID-19; health system; medium term budgetary framework; public financial management",,,,,,,,,"(1993) World Development Report: Investing in Health, , Washington DC, World Bank; (1978), Paper presented at International Conference on Primary Health Care; 6–12 September,, Alma-Ata, USSR; (2000) World Health Report: Improving Health Systems, , Geneva, Switzerland, World Health Organization; (2000) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly. 55/2.

Several reports on epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been published. However, mortality and morbidity analyses, important for better understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, are scarce. We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19. Methods. The cohort consisted of 11 male and 3 female patients, with 9 patients aged 70 years or above, and nearly all had underlying diseases. Results. Fever with bilateral pneumonia was the main manifestation. Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest computed tomography scan. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested. In addition, this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in all 8 patients tested. Conclusions. The clinical and laboratory parameters in the cohort of fatal cases may be incorporated into future clinical prognosis models and will be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. © The Author(s) 2020.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Mortality; Pneumonia; Risk assessment; SARS-CoV-2","alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma glutamyltransferase; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; tumor necrosis factor; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; blood cell count; clinical article; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; eosinophil count; female; fever; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; glucose blood level; hematocrit; human; leukocytosis; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; male; middle aged; mortality; mycoplasmosis; pleura effusion; pneumonia; priority journal; respiratory failure; retrospective study; septic shock; thorax radiography; throat culture; very elderly",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; gamma glutamyltransferase, 85876-02-4; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A",,,,,,"Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China JAMA; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Yingjie Wu, W.G., Liu, H., Qi, B., Clinical outcomes of 402 patients with COVID-2019 from a single center in Wuhan, China MedRxiv; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 514-523; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 270-273; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Tian, H.Y., 2019-nCoV: New challenges from coronavirus [in Chinese] (2020) Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi, 54, p.

Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death. Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear. We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from ASAIO.

Primary care providers are in the frontline. COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets contaminating surfaces and hands that then transmit the virus to another person’s respiratory system. The incubation period is 2–9 days and the majority of cases are mild. The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Older people and those with cardiopulmonary comorbidities or immunological deficiency will be more at risk of severe disease. If people meet the case definition, the primary care provider should immediately adopt infection prevention and control measures. Diagnosis is made by a RT-PCR test using respiratory secretions, usually nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Mild cases can be managed at home with self-isolation, symptomatic treatment and follow-up if the disease worsens. Contact tracing is very important. Observed case fatality is between 0.5% and 4%, but may be overestimated as mild cases are not always counted. Primary care providers must give clear, accurate and consistent messages on infection prevention and control in communities and homes. © 2020, AOSIS (pty) Ltd.

This infection, which was declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization, is particularly dangerous for dialysis patients, as they are frail and more vulnerable to infections due to the overlap of multiple pathologies. In patients with full-blown symptoms, there is a renal impairment of various degrees in 100% of the subjects observed. However, as Covid-19 is an emerging disease, more work is needed to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment strategies. It is essential to avoid nosocomial spread; in order to control and reduce the rate of infections it is necessary to strengthen the management of medical and nursing personnel through the early diagnosis, isolation and treatment of patients undergoing dialysis treatment. We cover here a series of recommendations for the treatment of dialysis patients who are negative to the virus, and of those who are suspected or confirmed positive.

In turn, this situation is leading to the decline of certain mainstream business formats and, simultaneously, the emergence of others. Based on a review of recent crisis recovery processes, the tourism sector is likely to rebound from this sudden market shock, primarily because of various forms of government interventions. Nevertheless, although policymakers seek to strengthen the resilience of post-pandemic tourism, their subsidies and other initiatives serve to maintain a fundamentally flawed market logic. The crisis has, therefore, brought us to a fork in the road–giving us the perfect opportunity to select a new direction and move forward by adopting a more sustainable path. Specifically, COVID-19 offers public, private, and academic actors a unique opportunity to design and consolidate the transition towards a greener and more balanced tourism. Tourism scholars, for example, can take a leading role in this by redesigning their curriculum to prepare future industry leaders for a more responsible travel and tourism experience. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Immune system processes and functionalities are organized as circadian rhythms, and they are also strongly influenced by sleep status. Sleep is a vital behavioral state of living beings and a modulator of immune function and responsiveness. Shiftworkers show increased risk for developing viral infections due to possible compromise of both innate and acquired immunity responses. Short sleep and sleep loss, common consequences of shiftwork, are associated with altered integrity of the immune system. We discuss the possible excess risk for COVID-19 infection in the context of the common conditions among shiftworkers, including nurses, doctors, and first responders, among others of high exposure to the contagion, of sleep imbalance and circadian disruption.

Several clinical studies reported that some patients with low or medium fever, or even without obvious symptom, rapidly progressed to severe or critical illness, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, coagulation disorders and intractable metabolic acidosis. These patients were usually associated with significant elevated serum levels of a profile of cytokines, which is similar to SARS-2003 and MERS-2015, indicating the occurrence of cytokine storm. In the present review, we summarized previous advances in the treatment of severe cases of SARS by using traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), especially those TCM targeting cytokine storm, based on literature mining. By using data mining and network pharmacology, we also investigated underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in the inhibitory effects of TCM against cytokine storm. This review not only provides novel insights in the precise application of TCM, appropriate integrative use of TCM in combination with western medicine, but also contributes to the discovery of novel drugs or new therapeutic strategies targeting cytokine storm to suppress progression of COVID-19 and to improve clinical prognosis and outcomes. © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

Therefore, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common. Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with an adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma. Echocardiography provides information of heart involvement, detects cor pulmonale and shock states. © 2020 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Critically ill; Echocardiography; Echography; Ultrasound",,,,,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med., 382, pp. 727-733; Ayuela Azcarate, J.M., Clau Terré, F., Ochagavia, A., Vicho Pereira, R., [Role of echocardiography in the hemodynamic monitorization of critical patients] (2012) Med Intensiva., 36, pp. 220-232; Ayuela Azcárate, J.M., Clau- Terré, F., Vicho Pereira, R., Guerrero de Mier, M., Carrillo López, A., Ochagavia, A., [Consensus document on ultrasound training in Intensive Care Medicine.

The factor that caused this clinic was called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the following days, WHO officially named the disease caused by the new coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 mostly applied to health centers with symptoms of dry cough, shortness of breath and fever. some patients have developed death-causing complications such as organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infects patients by binding human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2), causing to severe pneumonia and high mortality. Circulating RAS and local paracrin-autocrin-intracrin tissue-based RAS participate in numerous pathobiological events. Pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and pro-thrombotic consequences associated with local RAS activation have been detected at cellular and molecular level. Regenerative progenitor cell therapy in response to RAS-modulating pharmacotherapy in context of endothelial cell damage and regeneration emerged as an auxiliary therapy to improve regeneration of the vascular endothelium. The aim of this article is to evaluate the relationship between circulating and local angiotensin systems and COVID-19. © 2020, UHOD - Uluslararasi Hematoloji Onkoloji Dergisi.

The causative agent was identified as a novel β-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named COVID-19. Since the beginning of 2020, the infection has spread worldwide, which led the WHO to declare COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern and to characterize the current situation as a pandemic. The transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Most cases are mild, but some patients develop severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress, septic shock and multi-organ failure. The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough, myalgia and shortness of breath. Characteristic laboratory findings are normal white blood cell count or mild leukopenia, marked lymphopenia, in severe cases elevated CRP, procalcitonin, LDH, and D-dimer are commonly found. Typical imaging findings include multifocal peripherally distributed ground-glass opacities or consolidations, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving appearance and cystic changes. The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range from 1 to 3%, however, it is dependent on age and underlying medical comorbidities. Current potential treatment options include hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne.

However, several safety concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chloroquine; COVID-19; Dosage regimens; Dose related toxicity; Modeling and simulation","Safety engineering; Adverse effect; Concentration levels; Length of hospital stays; Maximum tolerated dose; QT prolongation; Safety concerns; Safety information; Simulation technique; Patient treatment; azithromycin; chloroquine; aging; Article; body weight; cardiomyopathy; coronavirus disease 2019; dose response; drug accumulation; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug distribution; drug dose comparison; drug dose regimen; drug potentiation; drug safety; early intervention; high risk patient; human; hypoglycemia; lung edema; maximum tolerated dose; neurologic disease; priority journal; QT prolongation; respiratory failure; retention time; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; simulation; visual disorder",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7",,,,,,"Albertson, T.E., (2012), Chapter 51.

In this article, we reflect on how insights from the literature on career shocks can help us understand the career consequences of the pandemic and offer suggestions for future research in this area. In particular, we offer three “key lessons”. The first lesson is that the implications of Covid-19 reflect the dynamic interplay between individual and contextual factors. Here, we argue that although the pandemic was difficult to predict and control, research shows that certain psychological resources – such as career competencies and resilience – could make this career shock more manageable. The second lesson is that the pandemic may have differential implications over time, as suggested by research that has shown the consequences of career shocks to differ between short-term vs. long-term time horizons, and across life- and career stages. The third lesson is that, even though the pandemic is clearly a negatively valenced shock for most people, further into the future it may allow for more positive outcomes. This lesson builds on research showing how negative career shocks have long-term positive consequences for some people. We hope that these insights will inspire both scholars and practitioners to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with its consequences. © 2020 The Authors",,,,,,,,,,"Akkermans, J., Brenninkmeijer, V., Schaufeli, W.B., Blonk, R.W.B., It's all about CareerSKILLS: Effectiveness of a career development intervention for young employees (2015) Human Resource Management, 54 (4), pp. 533-551; Akkermans, J., Seibert, S.E., Mol, S.T., Tales of the unexpected: Integrating career shocks in the contemporary careers literature (2018) SA Journal of Industrial Psychology, 44; Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Job demands–resources theory: Taking stock and looking forward (2017) Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 22 (3), pp. 273-285. , (Journal of Occupational Health Psychology at 20); Baruch, Y., Lavi-Steiner, O., The career impact of management education from an average-ranked university: Human capital perspective (2015) Career Development International, 20 (3), pp. 218-237; Baruch, Y., Wordsworth, R., Mills, C., Wright, S., Career and work attitudes of blue-collar workers, and the impact of a natural disaster chance event on the relationships between intention to quit and actual quit behaviour (2016) European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 25 (3), pp. 459-473; Blokker, R., Akkermans, J., Tims, M., Jansen, P., Khapova, S., Building a sustainable start: The role of career competencies, career success, and career shocks in young professionals' employability (2019) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 112, pp. 172-184; Bourdieu, P., Wacquant, L.J.D., An invitation to reflexive sociology (1992), University of Chicago Press; Chen, Y., Liu, D., Tang, G., Hogan, T.M., Workplace events and employee creativity: A multi-study field investigation (2020) Personnel Psychology, , (in press); Chudzikowski, K., Mayrhofer, W., In search of the blue flower?

In the past 20 years, this is the third coronavirus that jumped the species barrier and infected humans. It is highly contagious but associated with low pathogenicity. First identified in Wuhan, China, a city of over 11 million, the disease has since spread to every continent except Antarctica. About 15% to 20% of all cases may be called severe, and it is believed many cases are asymptomatic. The average age of a person with COVID has been reported as 49 years. Worse outcomes are associated with geriatric populations and those with un-derlying diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory disorders, and/or diabetes. The coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, is highly contagious and has a latency period of about 14 days. Most patients present with fever and a dry cough, but fever may be absent. Differential diagnosis can be challenging since influenza may present with similar symptoms. Chest radiography or computed to-mography may be used to find evidence of secondary pneumonia. Nosocomial infection is of concern, and it has been reported that 3.8% of all cases with COVID-19 in that country involve healthcare workers in China. Most patients have mild disease, and supportive care suffices. A variety of repurposed and investigational drugs are being evaluated. There are currently no antiviral therapies or vaccines, even if many therapies are proposed. Hand hygiene, social distancing, and scientifically sound information are the best strategies at the moment to combat this epidemic. © 2020, Author(s).","Anti-inflammatory; Coronavirus; Corticosteroids; COVID-19; Infection; MERS; NSAIDs; SARS","antipyretic agent; C reactive protein; chloroquine; favipiravir; procalcitonin; remdesivir; activated partial thromboplastin time; age; bacterial pneumonia; case fatality rate; China; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; differential diagnosis; disease course; disease predisposition; dyspnea; extracorporeal oxygenation; fever; hand washing; health care personnel; homeostasis; hospital infection; human; intensive care unit; latent period; lymphocyte count; monocyte count; pandemic; plasma transfusion; pregnancy; prothrombin time; Review; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; thorax radiography; virus morphology; virus transmission; virus virulence",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3",,,"National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA","Authors’ Contribution: Jo Ann LeQuang prepared the first draft.

As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24–3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated outbreak, the better we can respond. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2019-nCoV;

We review the evidence on how estimates of potential output, which are at the heart of essential control indicators in EU fiscal surveillance, were revised in the ten years running up to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how these revisions affected the fiscal stance of EU countries. We provide first evidence for downward revisions in the European Commission’s potential output estimates against the background of the COVID-19 shock across the EU27 countries, and we assess the potential consequences in terms of fiscal space. According to our results, one additional percentage point in predicted losses of actual output is associated with a loss in potential output of about 0.6 percentage points. Given the importance of model-based estimates in the EU’s fiscal rules, avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal tightening will require that policymakers’ hands are not tied by overly pessimistic views on the development of potential output. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,"Ball, L., Long-term damage from the Great Recession in OECD countries (2014) European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies, 11 (2), pp. 149-160; Blanchardleigh, O.D., (2013) Growth Forecast Errors and Fiscal Multipliers, , IMF Working Paper, WP/13/1; Blanchard, O.E., Ceruttisummers, L., (2015) Inflation and activity—two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications, , IMF Working Paper, WP/15/230; Buti, M.N., Carnot, A., Hristov, K., Mc Morrow, W., Roegervandermeulen, V., (2019) Potential Output and EU Fiscal Surveillance, VOX CEPR Policy Portal, , https://voxeu.org/article/potential-output-and-eu-fiscal-surveillance, 23 September, 2 December 2019; Ciuccizoppe, M.A., (2016) Potential output estimates and their role in the EU fiscal policy surveillance, , European Parliament Briefing, PE574.407; Coibion, O., Gorodnichenko, Y., Ulate, M., The cyclical sensitivity in estimates of potential output (2018) Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2018 (2), pp. 343-441; Costantini, O., Political economy of the Stability and Growth Pact (2017) European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies: Intervention, 14 (3), pp. 333-350; De Grauwe, P., Ji, Y., From Panic-Driven Austerity to Symmetric Macroeconomic Policies in the Eurozone (2013) Journal of Common Market Studies, 51 (S1), pp. 31-41; (2015) Making the best use of the flexibility within the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, , COM(2015)012 final; Vade mecum on the Stability and Growth Pact: 2019 edition, European Economy (2019) Institutional Papers, 101; Communication from the Commission to the Council on the activation of the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact (2020) COM(2020) 123 Final, , (a); Communication from the Commission: Economic governance review (2020) SWD (2020) 2010 Final, , (b); Fatas, A., Fiscal policy, potential output, and the shifting goalposts (2019) IMF Economic Review, 67 (3), pp. 684-702; Fatas, A., Summers, L., The permanent effects of fiscal consolidation (2018) Journal of International Economics, 112 (C), pp. 238-250; Fontanari, C.A., Palumbosalvatori, C., (2019) Potential output in theory and practice: A revision and update of Okun’s original method, 93. , Institute for New Economic Thinking Working Paper; Gualtieri, R., (2019) Letter from Italy to the European Commission, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/minister_gualtieri_-_letter_to_ec_23_10_2019_1.pdf, 23 October, (3 August 2019); Havik, K.K., Mc Morrow, F., Orlandi, C., Planas, R., Raciborski, W., Roeger, A., Rossi, A., Thum-Thysenvandermeulen, V., (2014) The Production Function Methodology for Calculating Potential Growth Rates &, p. 535. , Output Gaps, European Economy Economic Papers; Heimberger, P., Did Fiscal Consolidation Cause the Double-Dip Recession in the Euro Area?

We find that regional policy coordination is critical to mitigate and isolate the pandemic shock. It is important to identify the pandemic events early to flatten the pandemic curve at the national and regional level. This supports a recent study by the World Bank (2020), which highlights the importance of early mitigation policies during the pandemic shock. The cost of the pandemic and economic shocks will increase significantly when several countries in the region experience the pandemic shock concurrently. In this case, flattening the regional pandemic curve becomes important. The results also indicate the need for greater coordination in East Asia to mitigate the pending economic shock in terms of unemployment, corporate bankruptcy and financial market fragility. The paper also highlights that the stability of the GVC network is critical during the pandemic in terms of hedging the risk of disruptions to the procurement of critical medical and health products as well as maintaining service linkages to manufacturing, such as the logistics sector. Regional policy coordination and the stability of GVC will be valuable in the post-pandemic recovery of the region. © 2020 East Asian Economic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","COVID-19; global value chains; regional cooperation","bankruptcy; COVID-19; financial crisis; financial market; policy analysis; respiratory disease; unemployment; viral disease; Far East",,,,,,,,"Abe, S., Thangavelu, S.M., Natural disasters in Asia: Introduction (2012) Asian Economic Journal, 26, pp. 181-187; (2020), The Economic Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Developing Asia,, ADB Briefs, 6 March.

Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase – Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1–2 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children. © 2020, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Acute lung injury; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine;

First, those with COVID-19 and pre-existing cardiovascular disease have an increased risk of severe disease and death. Second, infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. Third, therapies under investigation for COVID-19 may have cardiovascular side effects. Fourth, the response to COVID-19 can compromise the rapid triage of non-COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular conditions. Finally, the provision of cardiovascular care may place health care workers in a position of vulnerability as they become hosts or vectors of virus transmission. We hereby review the peer-reviewed and pre-print reports pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems. © 2020 American College of Cardiology Foundation","cardiovascular therapy; coronavirus; health system","alpha interferon; anakinra; antiarrhythmic agent; antibiotic agent; anticoagulant agent; antithrombocytic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; beta interferon; bevacizumab; calcium channel blocking agent; chloroquine; colchicine; eculizumab; evolocumab; fingolimod; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; methylprednisolone; pirfenidone; remdesivir; ribavirin; sarilumab; steroid; tocilizumab; tranexamic acid; unindexed drug; warfarin; acute coronary syndrome; artery thrombosis; atrioventricular block; bradycardia; cardiac graft rejection; cardiogenic shock; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; disease severity; drug mechanism; drug megadose; drug potentiation; electrolyte disturbance; emergency health service; health care personnel; health care system; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart bundle branch block; heart failure; heart infarction; heart muscle injury; heart transplantation; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; hemolytic anemia; human; hypertension; hypotension; medical education; medical ethics; medical information; mortality; myocardial disease; myocarditis; nonhuman; pandemic; pathophysiology; peripheral edema; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; QT prolongation; retina artery occlusion; retina vein occlusion; Review; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; side effect; tachycardia; thromboembolism; torsade des pointes; unspecified side effect; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; virus transmission; vulnerable population; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; myocarditis; virology; virus pneumonia; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Heart Diseases; Humans; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Triage",,"anakinra, 143090-92-0; bevacizumab, 216974-75-3, 1438851-35-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; eculizumab, 219685-50-4; evolocumab, 1256937-27-5; fingolimod, 162359-56-0; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; methylprednisolone, 6923-42-8, 83-43-2; pirfenidone, 53179-13-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; tranexamic acid, 1197-18-8, 701-54-2; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2",,,"Center for Social Inclusion, CSI

However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined 'hyperferritinemic syndrome', which already includes adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This approach has the potential to protect the most vulnerable from disease and provide society an incalculable economic benefit. Allo-priming healthy elderly adults is proposed to provide universal protection from progression of any type of viral infection, including protection against progression of the current outbreak of COVID-19 infection, and any future variants of the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus or the next 'Disease X'. Allo-priming is an alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic that provides a back-up in case vaccination strategies to elicit neutralizing antibody protection fails or fails to protect the vulnerable elderly population. The allo-priming is performed using activated, intentionally mismatched, ex vivo differentiated and expanded living Th1-like cells (AlloStim®) derived from healthy donors currently in clinical use as an experimental cancer vaccine. Multiple intradermal injections of AlloStim® creates a dominate titer of allo-specific Th1/CTL memory cells in circulation, replacing the dominance of exhausted memory cells of the aged immune system. Upon viral encounter, by-stander activation of the allo-specific memory cells causes an immediate release of IFN-Ï', leading to development of an ""anti-viral state"", by-stander activation of innate cellular effector cells and activation of cross-reactive allo-specific CTL. In this manner, the non-specific activation of allo-specific Th1/CTL initiates a cascade of spatial and temporal immune events which act to limit the early viral titer. The release of endogenous heat shock proteins (HSP) and DAMP from lysed viral-infected cells, in the context of IFN-Ï', creates of conditions for in situ vaccination leading to viral-specific Th1/CTL immunity. These viral-specific Th1/CTL provide sterilizing immunity and memory for protection from disease recurrence, while increasing the pool of Th1/CTL in circulation capable of responding to the next viral encounter. Conclusion: Allo-priming has potential to provide universal protection from viral disease and is a strategy to reverse immunosenescence and counter-regulate chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Allo-priming can be used as an adjuvant for anti-viral vaccines and as a counter-measure for unknown biological threats and bio-economic terrorism. © 2020 The Author(s).","Cell therapy; COVID-19; Immunosenescence;

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features have been partially characterized in some observational studies. No systematic reviews on COVID-19 have been published to date. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess clinical, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Observational studies and also case reports, were included, and analyzed separately. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results: 660 articles were retrieved for the time frame (1/1/2020-2/23/2020). After screening, 27 articles were selected for full-text assessment, 19 being finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, 39 case report articles were included and analyzed separately. For 656 patients, fever (88.7%, 95%CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95%CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95%CI 10.9–80.4%) were the most prevalent manifestations. Among the patients, 20.3% (95%CI 10.0–30.6%) required intensive care unit (ICU), 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95%CI 13.7–51.8), 6.2% (95%CI 3.1–9.3) with shock. Some 13.9% (95%CI 6.2–21.5%) of hospitalized patients had fatal outcomes (case fatality rate, CFR). Conclusion: COVID-19 brings a huge burden to healthcare facilities, especially in patients with comorbidities. ICU was required for approximately 20% of polymorbid, COVID-19 infected patients and hospitalization was associated with a CFR of >13%. As this virus spreads globally, countries need to urgently prepare human resources, infrastructure and facilities to treat severe COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical features; Coronavirus disease 2019; Epidemic; Laboratory; Outcomes; SARS-CoV-2","adult respiratory distress syndrome; case fatality rate; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diagnostic imaging; dyspnea; fatality; fever; hospital patient; human; intensive care unit; laboratory test; meta analysis; prevalence; priority journal; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; shock; systematic review; thorax radiography; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; hospitalization; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Fever; Hospitalization; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",,,,,,"Contents of this article have been presented in conferences at the ESE Hospital Santa Monica, Dosquebradas, Risaralda, Colombia, March 6, 2020; Universidad Tecnologica de Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia, Symposium on Neglected Tropical Diseases, February 1, 2020, and Fundaci?n Universitaria Aut?noma de las Am?ricas, Pereira, Risaralda, Colombia, February 20, 2020 and subsequently by Facebook Live.",,"Bonilla-Aldana, D.K., Dhama, K., Rodriguez-Morales, A.J., Revisiting the one health approach in the context of COVID-19: a look into the ecology of this emerging disease (2020) Adv Anim Vet Sci, 8, pp. 234-237; Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., Li, X., Yang, B., Song, J., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China (2019) N Engl J Med, , 2020; Chan, J.F.-W., Yuan, S., Kok, K.-H., To, K.K.-W., Chu, H., Yang, J., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; The, L., Emerging understandings of 2019-nCoV (2020) Lancet, 395, p. 311; Bastola, A., Sah, R., Rodriguez-Morales, A.J., Lal, B.K., Jha, R., Ojha, H.C., The first 2019 novel coronavirus case in Nepal (2020) Lancet Infect Dis, 20, pp. 279-280; Bonilla-Aldana, D.K., Villamil-Gómez, W.E., Rabaan, A.A., Rodriguez-Morales, A.J., Una nueva zoonosis viral de preocupación global: COVID-19, enfermedad por coronavirus 2019 (2020) Iatreia, p. 33; Millan-Oñate, J., Rodríguez-Morales, A.J., Camacho-Moreno, G., Mendoza-Ramírez, H., Rodríguez-Sabogal, I.A., Álvarez-Moreno, C., A new emerging zoonotic virus of concern: the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (2020) Infectio, p. 24; Ksiazek, T.G., Erdman, D., Goldsmith, C.S., Zaki, S.R., Peret, T., Emery, S., A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1953-1966; Li, Q., Guan, X., Wu, P., Wang, X., Zhou, L., Tong, Y., Early transmission dynamics in wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (2020) N Engl J Med; Phan, L.T., Nguyen, T.V., Luong, Q.C., Nguyen, T.V., Nguyen, H.T., Le, H.Q., Importation and human-to-human transmission of a novel coronavirus in vietnam (2020) N Engl J Med; Pongpirul, W.A., Pongpirul, K., Ratnarathon, A.C., Prasithsirikul, W., Journey of a Thai taxi driver and novel coronavirus (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (11), pp. 1067-1068; Gorbalenya, A.E., Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus – the species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2020), bioRxiv 2020.02.07.937862; Drosten, C., Gunther, S., Preiser, W., van der Werf, S., Brodt, H.R., Becker, S., Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) N Engl J Med, 348, pp. 1967-1976; Kuiken, T., Fouchier, R.A., Schutten, M., Rimmelzwaan, G.F., van Amerongen, G., van Riel, D., Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) Lancet, 362, pp. 263-270; de Wit, E., van Doremalen, N., Falzarano, D., Munster, V.J., SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses (2016) Nat Rev Microbiol, 14, pp. 523-534; Al-Tawfiq, J.A., Gautret, P., Asymptomatic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: extent and implications for infection control: a systematic review (2019) Trav Med Infect Dis, 27, pp. 27-32; Baharoon, S., Memish, Z.A., MERS-CoV as an emerging respiratory illness: a review of prevention methods (2019) Trav Med Infect Dis; Bonilla-Aldana, D.K., Quintero-Rada, K., Montoya-Posada, J.P., Ramirez, S., Paniz-Mondolfi, A., Rabaan, A., SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and now the 2019-novel CoV: have we investigated enough about coronaviruses?

The epidemic has led to interruptions in supply and decline in demand in some industries, causing supply chain risk spread through the industry chain to the entire network, which is very likely to trigger systemic risks. In order to simulate the risk contagion effect of the regional industrial supply chain under the influence of the epidemic, a network cascading failure model based on China's regional industrial network is proposed. We simulate the propagation of production suspension and liquidity risk in the case of unexpected interruption of supply and decline in demand in Hubei province as well as the rest part of China. The results show that risk propagation exhibits an abrupt transition with a critical time point. The risk spread is relatively slow and stable before the critical point. Once the critical point is exceeded, the accelerated spread makes the entire industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that under the impact of supply-side and demand-side shocks, different industries have heterogeneous effects on systemic risk levels. re industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that different industries have heterogeneous impact on systemic risk of the industry network under shocks from supply and demand side. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 disease which may present with mild, moderate, or severe illness. In severe cases, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock can occur. Individuals above 60 years and people with preexisting comorbidities are at higher risk for developing serious complications. The incubation period of this new pathogen ranges from 1 to 14 days and there is no preexisting immunity to the disease. Countries across the globe have adopted various prevention and control measures to minimize negative health impacts. India has adopted various public health measures which include social distancing measures, nationwide lockdown to reduce risk of exposure, widespread IEC messaging regarding hand-washing, usage of masks, and recommending avoidance of unnecessary travel to combat the spread of disease. This manuscript reviews the global situation, contextualizes India's disease control efforts, and outlines the possible way forward by identifying specific actions under the following headings: enhancing district preparedness, enabling care for patients, and broadening community and stakeholder engagement for India. © 2020 Indian Journal of Community Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","COVID-19; novel coronavirus; pandemic; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,,,,,,,"Guo, Y.R., Cao, Q.D., Hong, Z.S., Tan, Y.Y., Chen, S.D., Jin, H.J., The origin transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak-An update on the status (2020) Mil Med Res, 13 (7), p. 11; Yin, Y., Wunderink, R.G., MERS SARS and other coronaviruses as causes of pneumonia (2018) Respirol Carlton Vic, 23, pp. 130-137; Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., Wang, X.G., Hu, B., Zhang, L., Zhang, W., A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin (2020) Nature, 579, pp. 270-273; Zhang, T., Wu, Q., Zhang, Z., (2020) Pangolin Homology Associated with 2019-nCoV, , https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.19.950253v1, bioRxiv 2020.02.19.950253 [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 04]; Chan, J.F., Yuan, S., Kok, K.H., To, K.K., Chu, H., Yang, J., A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 514-523. , https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620301549, [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 01]; https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses, Q and A on Coronaviruses (COVID-19) [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 01]; https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/RevisedNationalClinicalManagementGuidelineforCOVID1931032020.pdf, Revised Guidelines on Clinical Management of COVID-19 [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 02]; https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/PreventionandManagementofCOVID19FLWEnglish.pdf, Role of Frontline Workers in Prevention and Management of Coronavirus [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 01]; http://english.www.gov.cn/2020special/5e32830ec6d019625c60433b/202003/26/content_WS5e7c6347c6d0c201c2cbf855.html, Clinical Protocols for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 V7 [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 01]; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/2019-ncov-factsheet.pdf, What you need to know about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).; [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 01]; Santarpia, J.L., Rivera, D.N., Herrera, V., Morwitzer, M.J., Creager, H., Santarpia, G.W., (2020) Transmission Potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Viral Shedding Observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, , https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039446v2, medRxiv 2020.03.23.20039446 [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 04]; Van Doremalen, N., Bushmaker, T., Morris, D.H., Holbrook, M.G., Gamble, A., Williamson, B.N., Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 1564-1567. , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2004973, [Last accessed on 2020 Apr 04]; https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf, Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; receptor; remdesivir; sarilumab; tocilizumab; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; convalescent plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; human; myocarditis; nonhuman; pericarditis; pharmaceutical care; plasma; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vein thrombosis; venous thromboembolism",,"chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; sarilumab, 1189541-98-7; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Coronavirus COVID-19 global cases by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) (2020), https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html, (Accessed 1 April 2020); Shi, S., Qin, M., Shen, B., Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan (2020), China JAMA Cardiology; Wang, D., Hu, B., Hu, C., Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia in Wuhan (2020) China JAMA, 323 (11), pp. 1061-1069; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395 (10229), pp. 1054-1062; Paules, C.I., Marston, H.D., Fauci, A.S., Coronavirus infections—more than just the common cold (2020) JAMA, 323 (8), pp. 707-708; (2020), https://www.cdc.gov/sars/surveillance/absence.html, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of the postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU, from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.",,"antidiuretic agent; argipressin[1 deamino]; hypotonic solution; brain injury; complication; Coronavirus infection; dehydration; diabetes insipidus; disease management; drug therapy; fluid therapy; human; hypernatremia; hyponatremia; inappropriate vasopressin secretion; neurogenic diabetes insipidus; neurosurgery; pandemic; postoperative complication; practice guideline; procedures; shock; virus pneumonia; Antidiuretic Agents; Brain Injuries; Coronavirus Infections; Deamino Arginine Vasopressin; Dehydration; Diabetes Insipidus; Diabetes Insipidus, Neurogenic; Disease Management; Fluid Therapy; Humans; Hypernatremia; Hyponatremia; Hypotonic Solutions; Inappropriate ADH Syndrome; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Postoperative Complications; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Saline Solution; Shock",,"argipressin[1 deamino], 113-81-5; Antidiuretic Agents; Deamino Arginine Vasopressin; Hypotonic Solutions; Saline Solution",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,1479683X,,,"32380474","English","Eur.

The role of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in the event of COVID-19–associated cardiovascular collapse has not been established. We reviewed the existing literature surrounding the role of VA-ECMO in the treatment of coronavirus-related cardiovascular collapse. COVID-19 is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared with previous coronavirus outbreaks (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). We found only 1 case report from China in which COVID-19–associated fulminant myocarditis and CS were successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery. We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. While accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration the availability of resources, perceived benefit, and risks of transmitting disease. © 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society",,,,,,,,,,"Rodriguez-Morales, A.J., Cardona-Ospina, J.A., Gutiérrez-Ocampo, E., Clinical, laboratory and imaging features of COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2020) Travel Med Infect Dis, , [Epub ahead of print];

Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed. Methods: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations. Results: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were: 1) infection control, 2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, 3) hemodynamic support, 4) ventilatory support, and 5) COVID-19 therapy. Conclusion: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new evidence in further releases of these guidelines. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Research design and methods In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 193 patients with severe covid-19 were collected. 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes. A severe case was defined as including at least one of the following criteria: (1) Respiratory rate >30/min. (2) Oxygen saturation ≤93%. (3) PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤300 mm Hg. (4) Patients, either with shock or respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, or combined with other organ failure, requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Results Of 193 patients with severe covid-19, 48 (24.9%) had diabetes. Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality. In addition, patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes had higher levels of leukocyte count, neutrophil count, high-sensitivity C reaction protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, interleukin (IL) 2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor α, D-dimer, fibrinogen, lactic dehydrogenase and N-Terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Among patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes, more non-survivors were men (30 (76.9%) vs 9 (23.1%)). Non-survivors had severe inflammatory response, and cardiac, hepatic, renal and coagulation impairment. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a trend towards poorer survival in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes than patients without diabetes. The HR was 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.30; p=0.041) after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease by Cox regression. The median survival durations from hospital admission in patients with severe covid-19 with and without diabetes were 10 days and 18 days, respectively. Conclusion The mortality rate in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes is considerable. Diabetes may lead to an increase in the risk of death. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease are associated with a greater severity and higher fatality rate of covid-19. Furthermore, covid-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. The cardiovascular interactions of covid-19 have similarities to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and influenza. Specific cardiovascular considerations are also necessary in supportive treatment with anticoagulation, the continued use of renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system inhibitors, arrhythmia monitoring, immunosuppression or modulation, and mechanical circulatory support. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but about 5% develop severe symptoms, which can include acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Kidney involvement is frequent, with clinical presentation ranging from mild proteinuria to progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) necessitating renal replacement therapy (RRT). An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in the setting of critical illness and COVID-19 is emerging, although further research is needed to identify patients at risk of AKI and to guide management strategies. As no specific treatment options exist for AKI secondary to COVID-19, intensive care is largely supportive. Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19. International collaborative and cross-disciplinary research is needed to obtain adequate evidence to support current clinical approaches and to develop new approaches to management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,,,,,,,"Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1054-1062; Cheng, Y., Luo, R., Wang, K., Kidney disease is associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 (2020) Kidney Int, 97, pp. 829-838; Acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients.

Although COVID-19 leads to little or mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of affected patients, the disease may cause severe, frequently lethal complications such as progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure driven by hyperinflammation and a cytokine storm syndrome. This situation causes various major challenges for gastroenterology. In the context of IBD, several key questions arise. For instance, it is an important question to understand whether patients with IBD (eg, due to intestinal ACE2 expression) might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 and the cytokine release syndrome associated with lung injury and fatal outcomes. Another highly relevant question is how to deal with immunosuppression and immunomodulation during the current pandemic in patients with IBD and whether immunosuppression affects the progress of COVID-19. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is reviewed with special reference to immune cell activation. Moreover, the potential implications of these new insights for immunomodulation and biological therapy in IBD are discussed. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

In this paper, we theorize a new notion—the viable supply chain (VSC). In our approach, viability is considered as an underlying SC property spanning three perspectives, i.e., agility, resilience, and sustainability. The principal ideas of the VSC model are adaptable structural SC designs for supply–demand allocations and, most importantly, establishment and control of adaptive mechanisms for transitions between the structural designs. Further, we demonstrate how the VSC components can be categorized across organizational, informational, process-functional, technological, and financial structures. Moreover, our study offers a VSC framework within an SC ecosystem. We discuss the relations between resilience and viability. Through the lens and guidance of dynamic systems theory, we illustrate the VSC model at the technical level. The VSC model can be of value for decision-makers to design SCs that can react adaptively to both positive changes (i.e., the agility angle) and be able to absorb negative disturbances, recover and survive during short-term disruptions and long-term, global shocks with societal and economical transformations (i.e., the resilience and sustainability angles). The VSC model can help firms in guiding their decisions on recovery and re-building of their SCs after global, long-term crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We emphasize that resilience is the central perspective in the VSC guaranteeing viability of the SCs of the future. Emerging directions in VSC research are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agility; COVID-19; Lean; Pandemic; Recovery; Resilience; Supply chain; Sustainability; Viability; Viable supply chain",,,,,,,,,"Allaoui, H., Guo, Y.N., Sarkis, J., Decision support for collaboration planning in sustainable supply chains (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, 229, pp. 761-774; Allesina, S., Azzi, A., Battini, D., Regattieri, A., Performance measurement in supply chains: new network analysis and entropic indexes (2010) International Journal of Production Research, 48 (8), pp. 2297-2321; Altay, N., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., Agility and Resilience as antecedents of supply chain performance under moderating effects of organizational culture within humanitarian setting: A dynamic capability view (2018) Production Planning and Control, 29 (14), pp. 1158-1174; Amindoust, A., A resilient-sustainable based supplier selection model using a hybrid intelligent method (2018) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 126, pp. 122-135; Araz, O.M., Choi, T.-M., Olson, D., Salman, F.S., Data analytics for operational risk management (2020) Decision Sciences, , (Forthcoming); Ashby, W.R., (1956) An introduction to cybernetics, , Chapman & Hall, London; Aubin, J.P., (1991) Viability theory, , Birkhäuser, Boston; Baryannis, G., Validi, S., Dani, S., Antoniou, G., Supply chain risk management and artificial intelligence: State of the art and future research directions (2019) International Journal of Production Research, 57 (7), pp. 2179-2202; Basole, R.C., Bellamy, M.A., Supply network structure, visibility, and risk diffusion: A computational approach (2014) Decision Sciences, 45 (4), pp. 1-49; Beer, S., (1985) Diagnosing the system for organisations, , Wiley, Chichester; Behzadi, G., O’Sullivan, M.J., Olsen, T.L., Zhang, A., Allocation flexibility for agribusiness supply chains under market demand disruption (2018) International Journal of Production Research, 56 (10), pp. 3524-3546; Bertalanffy Von, L., (1969) General System Theory, George Braziller; Bier, T., Lange, A., Glock, C.H., Methods for mitigating disruptions in complex supply chain structures: A systematic literature review (2020) International Journal of Production Research, 58 (6), pp. 1835-1856; Blackhurst, J., Craighead, C.W., Elkins, D., Handfield, R., An empirically derived agenda of critical research issues for managing supply-chain disruptions (2005) International Journal of Production Research, 43 (19), pp. 4067-4081; Blackhurst, J., Dunn, J., Craighead, C., An empirically derived framework of global supply resiliency (2011) Journal of Business Logistics, 32 (4), pp. 347-391; Brandenburg, M., Rebs, T., Sustainable supply chain management: A modeling perspective (2015) Annals of Operation Research, 229, pp. 213-252; Brintrup, A., Wang, Y., Tiwari, A., Supply networks as complex systems: A network science-based characterization (2015) IEEE Systems Journal, 99, pp. 1-12; Byrne, G.D., Dimitrov, L.M., Teti, R., van Houten, F., Wertheim, R., Biologicalisation: Biological transformation in manufacturing (2018) CIRP Journal of Manufacturing Science and Technology, 21, pp. 1-32; Casti, J.L., (1979) Connectivity, complexity and catastrophe in large-scale systems, , Wiley, New York and London; Cavalcantea, I.M., Frazzon, E.M., Forcellinia, F.A., Ivanov, D., A supervised machine learning approach to data-driven simulation of resilient supplier selection in digital manufacturing (2019) International Journal of Information Management, 49, pp. 86-97; Chen, Q., Li, X., Ouyang, Y., Joint inventory-location problem under the risk of probabilistic facility disruptions (2011) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 45 (7), pp. 991-1003; Chesbrough, H., (2020) To Recover Faster from Covid-19, Open Up: Managerial Implications from an Open Innovation Perspective, p. 1. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.04.010, Industrial Marketing Management, April; Choi, T.M., Chan, H.K., Yue, X., Recent development in big data analytics for business operations and risk management (2017) IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 47 (1), pp. 81-92; Choi, T.M., Lambert, J.H., Advances in risk analysis with big data (2017) Risk Analysis, 37 (8), pp. 1435-1442; Choi, T.Y., Rogers, D., Vakil, B., Coronavirus is a wake-up call for supply chain management (2020) Harvard Business Review, , 27 March; Choi, T.-M., Innovative “Bring-Service-Near-Your-Home” Operations under Corona-Virus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2) Outbreak: Can Logistics Become the Messiah?

The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary: The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth. © 2020 The Authors","Bricolage; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Crisis; Entrepreneurship; Policy",,,,,,,"We are indebted to JBVI action editor Pablo Mu?oz for his guidance during this rapid response research.

COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide and has been shown to have a wide spectrum of severity. COVID-19 has become a public health emergency of relevant international concern, and it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in the majority of cases. However, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and other complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death. Several cutaneous immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, are therapeutically managed with biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory drugs. The outbreak of COVID-19 affects the management of these chronic conditions, not only for those who are already receiving treatment but also for those who are about to start a new treatment to control their disease. In this article, the management of cutaneous immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"antivirus agent; baricitinib; biological product; corticosteroid; cyclosporine; dupilumab; hydroxychloroquine; immunosuppressive agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 2 receptor; interleukin 6; methotrexate; tumor necrosis factor; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; immunosuppressive agent; Article; atopic dermatitis; CD8 lymphocyte count; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; histiocytosis; human; immune response; immunomodulation; immunopathology; immunosuppressive treatment; infection risk; innate immunity; lung injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome; pandemic; primary immune response; priority journal; psoriasis; secondary immune response; skin disease; suppurative hidradenitis; virus replication; atopic dermatitis; Coronavirus infection; drug contraindication; immunology; immunomodulation; psoriasis; skin disease; suppurative hidradenitis; virus pneumonia; Contraindications, Drug; Coronavirus Infections; Dermatitis, Atopic; Hidradenitis Suppurativa; Humans; Immunomodulation; Immunosuppressive Agents; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psoriasis; Skin Diseases",,"baricitinib, 1187594-09-7; cyclosporine, 59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0; dupilumab, 1190264-60-8; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; Immunosuppressive Agents",,,,,,"(2020) Rapid Risk Assessment: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: Increased Transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK—seventh Update, , https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-pandemic, Accessed 1 Apr 2020; Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic, , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, Accessed 1 Apr 2020; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan (2020) China Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; Cascella, M., Rajnik, M., Cuomo, A., Features, evaluation and treatment coronavirus (COVID-19) (2020) Statpearls, , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/, Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing, Accessed 1 Apr 2020; Fung, S.-Y., Yuen, K.-S., Ye, Z.-W., A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses (2020) Emerg Microbes Infect, 9, pp. 558-570; Prompetchara, E., Ketloy, C., Palaga, T., Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic (2020) Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol, 38, pp. 1-9; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; Pedersen, S.F., Ho, Y.-C., SARS-CoV-2: a storm is raging (2020) J Clin Invest.; Chen, G., Wu, D., Guo, W., Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (2020) J Clin Invest.; Qin, C., Zhou, L., Hu, Z., Dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan (2020) China.

Given the paucity of proven data in treating COVID-19, management of these patients is difficult, rapidly evolving, and mainly based on anecdotal experience. We report 2 cases of heart transplant (HT) recipients with COVID-19. The first is a 59-year-old female with HT in 2012 who presented on March 20, 2020 with fever, hypoxia, and ground-glass opacities on chest X-ray. She quickly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock. Despite reduction in immunosuppression and treatment with tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she ultimately died from multiorgan failure. The second case is a 75-year-old man with HT in 2000 who presented on April 2, 2020 after curbside testing revealed positive COVID-19. Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started. Because of a lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated. The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home. These 2 cases highlight the wide range of different presentations of COVID-19 in HT recipients and the rapidity with which the management of these patients is evolving. © 2020 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","clinical research/practice;

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases have been the most common risk factors for severity and mortality. The hyperinflammatory response of the body, coupled with the plausible direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome on body-wide organs via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, has been associated with complications of the disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock, and multiorgan failure have precipitated death. Acknowledging the comorbidities and potential organ injuries throughout the course of COVID-19 is therefore crucial in the clinical management of patients. This paper aims to add onto the ever-emerging landscape of medical knowledge on COVID-19, encapsulating its multiorgan impact. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; Betacoronavirus; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; complication; Coronavirus infection; human; immunology; metabolism; multiple organ failure; pandemic; physiology; risk factor; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Multiple Organ Failure; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors",,"dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, 9015-82-1; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A",,,,,,"Zhu, N., Zhang, D., Wang, W., A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019 (2020) N Engl J Med, 382, pp. 727-733; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China [published online ahead of print, 2020 Feb 28] (2020) N Engl J Med, , NEJMoa2002032; Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China [published correction appears in Lancet. 2020 Jan 30;:] (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; (2020), https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200411-sitrep-82-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=74a5d15_2, WHO.

This new disease, due to its large diffusion, may significantly hamper the prognosis of other pathologies, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) because of (a) a possible direct negative impact and (b) shortage of first response medical resources and increased delays to reperfusion. We report the case of a 68-year-old man admitted for anterior STEMI and asymptomatic COVID-19. Due to extended transportation delays to a cathlab, he received intravenous fibrinolytic therapy, which failed. Reperfusion was achieved with rescue coronary angioplasty, but the patient experienced two episodes of acute stent thrombosis at 2- and 36-hr following admission and despite optimal medical therapy. He finally died because of cardiogenic shock. This raises concerns about a possible increase in platelet aggregability associated with COVID-19 leading to an increased risk of stent thrombosis, particularly in the context of STEMI. This pleads for the promotion of primary coronary angioplasty as the first-choice revascularization technique in this population and the use of new generation P2Y12 inhibitors. In addition, the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors may be considered in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to prevent the risk of acute stent thrombosis. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","acute myocardial infarction; antithrombotic treatment; viral infection",,,,,,,,,"Bonow, R.O., Fonarow, G.C., O'Gara, P.T., Association of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury and mortality (2020) JAMA Cardiol, , https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1105, [Epub ahead of print]; Zheng, Y.-Y., Ma, Y.-T., Zhang, J.-Y., COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system (2020) Nat Rev Cardiol, 17, pp. 259-260. , http://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5; Tam, C.-C.F., Cheung, K.-S., Lam, S., Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction Care in Hong Kong, China (2020) Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 13. , https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006631; Welt, F.G.P., Shah, P.B., Aronow, H.D., Catheterization laboratory considerations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: from ACC's interventional council and SCAI (2020) J Am Coll Cardiol, , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.03.021, [Epub ahead of print]; Zeng, J., Huang, J., Pan, L., How to balance acute myocardial infarction and COVID-19: the protocols from Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital (2020) Intensive Care Med, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-020-05993-9, [Epub ahead of print]; Moser, M., Nordt, T., Peter, K., Platelet function during and after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction with reteplase, alteplase, or streptokinase (1999) Circulation, 100, pp. 1858-1864; Han, H., Yang, L., Liu, R., Prominent changes in blood coagulation of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (2020) Clin Chem Lab Med, , https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0188, [Epub ahead of print]; Tang, N., Bai, H., Chen, X., Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy (2020) J Thromb Haemostasis, , https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14817, [Epub ahead of print]; Mattila, K.J., Viral and bacterial infections in patients with acute myocardial infarction (1989) J Intern Med, 225, pp. 293-296; Smeeth, L., Thomas, S.L., Hall, A.J., Hubbard, R., Farrington, P., Vallance, P., Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after acute infection or vaccination (2004) N Engl J Med, 351, pp. 2611-2618","Ivanes, F.; Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire de Tours, Service de CardiologieFrance; email: fabrice.ivanes@univ-tours.fr",,,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",,,,,15221946,,CARIF,,"English","Catheter.

It is also unknown whether the modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score is applicable for nutritional risk assessment in intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients. We set out to investigate the applicability of the mNUTRIC score for assessing nutritional risks and predicting outcomes for these critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in three ICUs which had been specially established and equipped for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The study population was critically ill COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to these ICUs between January 28 and February 21, 2020. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients of ＜18 years; 2) patients who were pregnant; 3) length of ICU stay of ＜24 h; 4) insufficient medical information available. Patients' characteristics and clinical information were obtained from electronic medical and nursing records. The nutritional risk for each patient was assessed at their ICU admission using the mNUTRIC score. A score of ≥5 indicated high nutritional risk. Mortality was calculated according to patients’ outcomes following 28 days of hospitalization in ICU. Results: A total of 136 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR: 57–77), 86 (63%) males and 50 (37%) females, were included in the study. Based on the mNUTRIC score at ICU admission, a high nutritional risk (≥5 points) was observed in 61% of the critically ill COVID-19 patients, while a low nutritional risk (<5 points) was observed in 39%. The mortality of ICU 28-day was significantly higher in the high nutritional risk group than in the low nutritional risk group (87% vs 49%, P ＜0.001). Patients in the high nutritional risk group exhibited significantly higher incidences of acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, secondary infection, shock and use of vasopressors. Additionally, use of a multivariate Cox analysis showed that patients with high nutritional risk had a higher probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.22–3.32, P = 0.006). Conclusions: A large proportion of critically ill COVID-19 patients had a high nutritional risk, as revealed by their mNUTRIC score. Patients with high nutritional risk at ICU admission exhibited significantly higher mortality of ICU 28-day, as well as twice the probability of death at ICU 28-day than those with low nutritional risk. Therefore, the mNUTRIC score may be an appropriate tool for nutritional risk assessment and prognosis prediction for critically ill COVID-19 patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism","28-Day mortality; Coronavirus disease 2019; Intensive care unit; Modified NUTRIC score; Nutritional risk",,,,,,"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST: 2020kfyXGYJ049

The risk factors for death were attributed to advanced age and comorbidities but have not been accurately defined.Objectives: To report the clinical features of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 in two hospitals in Wuhan.Methods: Medical records were collected of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 between January 9, 2020, and February 15, 2020. Information recorded included medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans, and clinical management.Measurements and Main Results: The median age of the patients was 65.8 years, and 72.9% were male. Common symptoms were fever (78 [91.8%]), shortness of breath (50 [58.8%]), fatigue (50 [58.8%]), and dyspnea (60 [70.6%]). Hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most common comorbidities. Notably, 81.2% of patients had very low eosinophil counts on admission. Complications included respiratory failure (80 [94.1%]), shock (69 [81.2%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (63 [74.1%]), and arrhythmia (51 [60%]), among others. Most patients received antibiotic (77 [90.6%]), antiviral (78 [91.8%]), and glucocorticoid (65 [76.5%]) treatments. A total of 38 (44.7%) and 33 (38.8%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and IFN-α2b, respectively.Conclusions: In this depictive study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19, most cases were males aged over 50 years with noncommunicable chronic diseases. The majority of the patients died of multiple organ failure. Early onset of shortness of breath may be used as an observational symptom for COVID-19 exacerbations. Eosinophilopenia may indicate a poor prognosis.

It typically presents with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and may have life threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures. Most common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%), while 0.2% patients had suicidal ideation. Early recognition and prompt management of neuropsychiatric manifestations in these patients have a potential to decrease overall morbidity and mortality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,,,"A Review of Pathophysiology and Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 DOI: 10.1007/s00415-020-09950-w; Avula, A., COVID-19 presenting as stroke (2020) Brain Behav.

Methods: Based on traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology platform (TCMSP), the chemical composition and targets of Arecae Semen, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Tsaoko Fructus, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Paeoniae Radix Alba, Scutellariae Radix, and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma were screened. The targets of corresponding gene were searched through UniProt, GeneCards databases, and then Cytoscape3.2.1 was used to build compound-targets (genes) networks. The enrichment of gene ontology (GO) function analysis by DAVID and the pathway enrichment analysis by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were carried out, the mechanism of its action was predicted. Results: The compound-target network contained 141 compounds and 267 corresponding targets, and the key targets involved PTGS2, HSP90AA1, ESR1, AR, NOS2, etc. The function enrichment analysis of GO was 522 (P < 0.05), of which there were 421 biological processes (BP) items, and 38 related items of cell composition (CC),and 63 molecular function (MF) items. There were 25 signal pathways (P < 0.05) in the KEGG pathway enrichment screening, involving small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and T cell receptor signaling pathways, etc. The results of molecular docking showed that the affinity of quercetin, kaempferol, baicalin and other core compounds was similar to recommended drugs recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion: The active compounds in Da-Yuan-Yin may regulate multiple signaling pathways by binding angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and acting on targets such as PTGS2, HSP90AA1 and ESR1 to inhibit COVID-19. © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system. Apart from being an infectious disease, it may affect human behavior and healthcare resource allocation which potentially cause treatment delay in MI. Methods: This was a single center cross-sectional observational study. From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19. Results: There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64). For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%). The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p =.02). Conclusions: More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes. Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ACS/NSTEMI; acute myocardial infarction/STEMI; health care outcomes",,,,,,,,,"Cucinotta, D., Vanelli, M., WHO declares COVID-19 a pandemic (2020) Acta Biomed, 91 (1), pp. 157-160; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032, [Epub ahead of print]; Tam, C.F., Cheung, K.S., Lam, S., Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction care in Hong Kong, China (2020) Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 13 (4). , https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006631; Thygesen, K., Alpert, J.S., Jaffe, A.S., Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) (2018) Circulation, 138 (20), pp. e618-e651; Amsterdam, E.A., Wenger, N.K., Brindis, R.G., 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (2014) Circulation, 130 (25), pp. e344-e426; Ibanez, B., James, S., Agewall, S., 2017 ESC guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation: the task force for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) (2018) Eur Heart J, 39 (2), pp. 119-177; Roffi, M., Patrono, C., Collet, J.P., 2015 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation: task force for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) (2016) Eur Heart J, 37 (3), pp. 267-315","Tam, C.-C.F.; Cardiology Division, Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong KongChina; email: frankie.tamcc@gmail.com",,,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",,,,,15221946,,CARIF,"32367683","English","Catheter.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" for clinical practice. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients' blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The ""Four-Anti and Two-Balance"" strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, two weeks' quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.",,"Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; disease management; early diagnosis; feces; human; isolation and purification; pandemic; sputum; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Early Diagnosis; Feces; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sputum",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10089292,,,"32391658","Chinese","Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084392394

The effects of demand-side shocks on food supply chains are discussed, including consumer panic buying behaviors with respect to key items, and the sudden change in consumption patterns away from the food service sector to meals prepared and consumed at home. Potential supply-side disruptions to food supply chains are assessed, including labor shortages, disruptions to transportation networks, and “thickening” of the Canada–U.S. border with respect to the movement of goods.

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Methods: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. Results: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"alanine aminotransferase;

Sensitivity of RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) testing is presumed to be high, but there is no gold standard against which this has been determined. The objective was to determine whether lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurs in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with clinical testing of both specimen types. Methods: Between March 26, 2020 and April 17, 2020 at the University of Washington Medical Center all patients with BALF specimens clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. We assessed the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in BALF after negative NP testing. We describe 3 cases with positive testing in BALF. Results: Among 16 patients with BALF samples, 3 cases (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in BALF. In Case 1, negative NP testing occurred early in the infection and respiratory symptoms may have been missed due to neurologic injury. In Case 2, outpatient diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia, but clinical suspicion remained high for COVID-19 at hospitalization based on epidemiological and clinical features. All 3 cases involved older adults (age >65 years), one of whom was immunosuppressed in the setting of lung transplantation (Case 3). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 LRTI occurs in the presence of negative NP testing. NP testing may underestimate the prevalence of COVID-19 and has implications for spread of SARS-CoV2 in the community and healthcare setting. © 2020 The Authors",,"acute graft rejection; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; aspiration pneumonia; brain death; brain hemorrhage; brain hernia; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; bronchoscopy; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; female; fever; human; limit of detection; lung injury; lung transplantation; male; nasopharyngeal testing; priority journal; respiratory failure; respiratory tract examination; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; thorax radiography; transbronchial biopsy; ventilator associated pneumonia; very elderly; virus load",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: K23HL138154-01

METHODS We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both. Mortality among these critically ill patients was high. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)

Methods: A total of 89 cases COVID-19 patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 17, 2020 to February 20, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively, and the clinical characteristics, course of treatment and prognosis were summarized. Results: According to the guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia, 89 cases were divided into mild group (n=18, 20.2%), common group (n=40, 44.9%), severe group (n=21, 23.6%), and critical group (n=10, 11.2%). There were significant differences in the incidence of fever, dry cough and dyspnea among the four groups (P<0.05). Compared with those in mild group, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), lymphocyte count (LYM), and monocyte count (MONO) increased significantly in the other three groups, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cr), urea nitrogen (Urea) and troponin I (cTnI) increased significantly in severe and critical groups (P<0.05). Compared with those in common group, the LYM of the severe and the critical patients were significantly lower, while the CRP, Cr, urea and cTnI levels increased significantly (P<0.05). Among the 89 patients, 6 patients (6.7%) had acute myocardial injury, 6 patients (6.7%) had respiratory failure, 3 patients (3.4%) had renal failure, and 3 patients had shock (3.4%). There were significant differences in myocardial injury, respiratory failure, and shock incidences among the four groups (P<0.05). Among the 89 patients, 7 patients (7.9%) were died, 82 patients (92.1%) were cured and discharged from hospital. Among them, there was no death in mild group, 1 patient (2.5%) was died in common group, 3 patients (14.3%) were died in severe group, and 3 patients (30.0%) were died in critical group. There was a significant difference in mortality among the four groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients in severe and critical classification are more serious in inflammatory reaction, and more prone to myocardial injury, respiratory failure and shock. © 2020, Editorial Board of Medical Journal of Wuhan University.

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. Objectives: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19. Search methods: The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria: We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group). We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins. Data collection and analysis: We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment. To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. Main results: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised. Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support. We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19. The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge. All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support). Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). Time to discharge from hospital. Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy. Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU). Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation. Length of stay on the ICU. Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events. The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 °C). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events. One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low. No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here. Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Most patients have a good prognosis while some with severe conditions could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even die. The exacerbation of the patient's condition may be due to a cytokine storm in the body. Effective targeted therapies including antiviral and immunization are urgently needed. Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently. We summarize the current therapeutic medicines used in the clinic, hope to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Antiviral; COVID-19; Immunization; Therapy","alpha interferon; arbidol; azithromycin; Chinese drug; chloroquine; corticosteroid; favipiravir; huashibaidufang; hydroxychloroquine; interferon; jinhua qinggan; lianhua qingwen; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; placebo; qingfeipaidu; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; xuanfeibaidufang; xuebijing; adult respiratory distress syndrome; blood clotting disorder; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; disease severity; fatigue; fever; human; metabolic acidosis; Middle East respiratory syndrome; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; prognosis; QT prolongation; Review; septic shock; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; favipiravir, 259793-96-9; hydroxychloroquine, 118-42-3, 525-31-5; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ribavirin, 36791-04-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,"Key Medical Subjects of Jiangsu Province: ZDRCA2016019

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24–72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0–2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) patients, of whom 20 (20%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a HIS. During the 10-day follow-up, three cases of severe adverse events were recorded: two patients developed septic shock and died, one had gastrointestinal perforation requiring urgent surgery and was alive at day 10. In conclusion, our series showed that COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS was characterized by HIS. The response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"monoclonal antibody; tocilizumab; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; female; human; Italy; male; middle aged; pandemic; prospective study; virology; virus pneumonia; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",,"tocilizumab, 375823-41-9; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; tocilizumab",,,,,,"Italian Ministry of Health, (2020), http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4370_1_file.pdf; Grasselli, G., Zangrillo, A., Zanella, A., Antonelli, M., Cabrini, L., Castelli, A., Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy (2020) JAMA; Grasselli, G., Pesenti, A., Cecconi, M., Critical care utilization for the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: early experience and forecast during an emergency response (2020) JAMA - J Am Med Assoc; Mehta, P., McAuley, D.F., Brown, M., Sanchez, E., Tattersall, R.S., Manson, J.J., COVID-19: consider cytokine storm syndromes and immunosuppression (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1033-1034; McGonagle, D., Sharif, K., O'Regan, A., Bridgewood, C., Interleukin-6 use in COVID-19 pneumonia related macrophage activation syndrome (2020) Autoimmun Rev, 102537; Karakike, E., Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J., Macrophage activation-like syndrome: a distinct entity leading to early death in sepsis (2019) Front Immunol, 10; Lau, S.K.P., Lau, C.C.Y., Chan, K.H., Li, C.P.Y., Chen, H., Jin, D.Y., Delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of innate antiviral response by the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: implications for pathogenesis and treatment (2013) J Gen Virol, 94, pp. 2679-2690; Al-Ahmari, A., Is secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis behind the high fatality rate in Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus?

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) may serve as life-saving rescue therapy for refractory respiratory failure in the setting of acute respiratory compromise such as that induced by SARS-CoV-2. While still little is known on the true efficacy of ECMO in this setting, the natural resemblance of seasonal influenza's characteristics with respect to acute onset, initial symptoms, and some complications prompt to ECMO implantation in most severe, pulmonary decompensated patients. The present review summarizes the evidence on ECMO management of severe ARDS in light of recent COVID-19 pandemic, at the same time focusing on differences and similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and ECMO in terms of hematological and inflammatory interplay when these two settings merge. © 2020 The Author(s).",,"interleukin 11; interleukin 3; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; interleukin 9; thrombopoietin; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; blood clotting; blood clotting disorder; cardiogenic shock; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; extracorporeal oxygenation; human; inflammation; lymphocytopenia; mortality; narrative; pandemic; platelet count; priority journal; respiratory failure; Review; seasonal influenza; septic shock; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptom; thrombocytopenia; Betacoronavirus; blood; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; pathophysiology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Blood Coagulation; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Thrombocytopenia",,"interleukin 8, 114308-91-7; thrombopoietin, 9014-42-0; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en, Accessed 3 Apr 2020; Zhou, G., Chen, S., Chen, Z., Back to the spring of Wuhan: Facts and hope of covid-19 outbreak (2020) Front Med., , ahead of print; Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Liang, W.H., Ou, C.Q., He, J.X., Liu, L., Zhong, N.S., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for C.

Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue prodrug, has inhibitory effects on pathogenic animal and human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in vitro, and inhibits Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an interval from symptom onset to enrolment of 12 days or less, oxygen saturation of 94% or less on room air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenous remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg on days 2–10 in single daily infusions) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients were permitted concomitant use of lopinavir–ritonavir, interferons, and corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, defined as the time (in days) from randomisation to the point of a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status (from 1=discharged to 6=death) or discharged alive from hospital, whichever came first. Primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and safety analysis was done in all patients who started their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04257656. Findings: Between Feb 6, 2020, and March 12, 2020, 237 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (158 to remdesivir and 79 to placebo); one patient in the placebo group who withdrew after randomisation was not included in the ITT population. Remdesivir use was not associated with a difference in time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio 1·23 [95% CI 0·87–1·75]). Although not statistically significant, patients receiving remdesivir had a numerically faster time to clinical improvement than those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of 10 days or less (hazard ratio 1·52 [0·95–2·43]). Adverse events were reported in 102 (66%) of 155 remdesivir recipients versus 50 (64%) of 78 placebo recipients. Remdesivir was stopped early because of adverse events in 18 (12%) patients versus four (5%) patients who stopped placebo early. Interpretation: In this study of adult patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19, remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits. However, the numerical reduction in time to clinical improvement in those treated earlier requires confirmation in larger studies.

The World Health Organization has announced a pandemia infection with an unknown species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80%), dry cough (56%), fatigue (22%) and muscle pain (7%); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills. A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services. Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus. © 2020 Via Medica.

It is currently categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Studies have focused on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal effects of this infection, but liver test abnormalities have also been documented. This alteration may be a consequence of viral hepatitis, pharmacological toxicity, inflammation, or shock. It is also considered a marker of prognosis and severity of the disease.

Competing health objectives and resource redeployment threaten to retard the scale-up of surgical services in low- and middle-income countries where access to safe, affordable and timely care is low. The key aspiration of the Lancet Commission on global surgery was promotion of resilience in surgical systems. The current pandemic provides an opportunity to stress-test those systems and identify fault-lines that may not be easily apparent outside of times of crisis. Methods: We endeavoured to explore vulnerable points in surgical systems learning from the experience of past outbreaks, using examples from the current pandemic, and make recommendations for future health emergencies. The 6-component framework for surgical systems planning was used to categorise the effects of COVID-19 on surgical systems, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries. Key vulnerabilities were identified and recommendations were made for the current pandemic and for the future. Results: Multiple stress points were identified throughout all of the 6 components of surgical systems. The impact is expected to be highest in the workforce, service delivery and infrastructure domains. Innovative new technologies should be employed to allow consistent, high-quality surgical care to continue even in times of crisis. Conclusions: If robust progress towards global surgery goals for 2030 is to continue, the stress points identified should be reinforced. An ongoing process of reappraisal and fortification will keep surgical systems in low- and middle-income countries responsive to “old threats and new challenges”. Multiple opportunities exist to help realise the dream of surgical systems resilient to external shocks. © 2020, Société Internationale de Chirurgie.",,,,,,,,,,"Martinez-Alvarez, M., Jarde, A., Usuf, E., COVID-19 pandemic in west Africa (2020) Lancet Glob Health; WHO Director-General’s Opening Remarks at the Media Briefing on COVID-19–11 Mar 2020, , https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19—11-march-2020, Accessed 9 Apr 2020; Gates, B., Responding to Covid-19—a once-in-a-century pandemic?

Community health workers are poised to play a pivotal role in fighting the pandemic, especially in countries with less resilient health systems. Drawing from practitioner expertise across four WHO regions, this article outlines the targeted actions needed at different stages of the pandemic to achieve the following goals: (1) PROTECT healthcare workers, (2) INTERRUPT the virus, (3) MAINTAIN existing healthcare services while surging their capacity, and (4) SHIELD the most vulnerable from socioeconomic shocks. While decisive action must be taken now to blunt the impact of the pandemic in countries likely to be hit the hardest, many of the investments in the supply chain, compensation, dedicated supervision, continuous training and performance management necessary for rapid community response in a pandemic are the same as those required to achieve universal healthcare and prevent the next epidemic. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.","health policy; health systems; public health",,,,,,,,,"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) Situation Reports, , https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports, World Health Organization.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit. © 2020 Massachusetts Medical Society.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatine kinase; creatinine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; virus RNA; antivirus agent; cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor; lopinavir; ritonavir; abdominal discomfort; acute heart failure; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; ambient air; anemia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; blood oxygen tension; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug fatality; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; flushing; gastritis; health care quality; hospitalization; human; human cell; human tissue; hyperbilirubinemia; hypoalbuminemia; laboratory test; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; nausea; neutropenia; oxygen saturation; pneumothorax; priority journal; QT prolongation; randomized controlled trial; rash; respiratory failure; respiratory tract infection; secondary infection; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; side effect; sleep disorder; stomach pain; thrombocytopenia; treatment withdrawal; unconsciousness; vomiting; Betacoronavirus; combination drug therapy; Coronavirus infection; genetics; hospital mortality; intention to treat analysis; isolation and purification; laboratory technique; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; patient acuity; proportional hazards model; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; time to treatment; treatment failure; virology; virus load; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Lopinavir; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Acuity; Pneumonia, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ritonavir; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Failure; Viral Load",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; lopinavir, 192725-17-0; ritonavir, 155213-67-5; Antiviral Agents; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Lopinavir; Ritonavir",,,"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF

However, it was this epidemic that highlighted this group of viruses and included them among the causative agents of emerging epidemic diseases. In addition, in 2012, another new CoV responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome was identified. Both infections were considered a threat to global health security. At present, the third epidemic caused by a CoV is being faced. This new CoV, called 2019-nCoV, was originated in the city of Wuhan, China, and has been linked to severe respiratory infections in humans. Thanks to the collaboration of experts worldwide, more information about this virus and its infection is reported each day, which allows modifying the recommendations for its prevention and treatment, without forgetting that the ultimate goal is to control this epidemic. In this review, the important aspects of this new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and its disease, COVID-19, have been summarized with the information available up to February 2020. © 2020 Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez.

In this essay we focus on three occupationally-related domains that may be impacted by the pandemic. First, perceptions of the value and status of different occupations may change, resulting in both changes of occupational supply and demand (macro changes) and changes in the perceived calling and meaningfulness of different occupations (micro changes). Second, the great “work from home experiment” may change occupational perspectives on working from home. Organizations and researchers may be able to better understand which occupational and individual characteristics are associated with work-from-home effectiveness and better designate occupational groups and individuals to working (or not working) from home. Third, we discuss the increased segmentation of the labor market which allocate workers to “good jobs” and “bad jobs” and the contribution of occupational segmentation to inequality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,"We thank Simon Restubog for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.",,"Artuç, E., Chaudhuri, S., McLaren, J., Trade shocks and labor adjustment: A structural empirical approach (2010) American Economic Review, 100 (3), pp. 1008-1045; Artuç, E., McLaren, J., Trade policy and wage inequality: A structural analysis with occupational and sectoral mobility (2015) Journal of International Economics, 97 (2), pp. 278-294; Ashiedu, J.A., Scott-Ladd, B.D., Understanding teacher attraction and retention drivers: Addressing teacher shortages (2012) Australian Journal of Teacher Education, 37 (11), p. 23; Autor, D.H., Dorn, D., Hanson, G.H., Song, J., Trade adjustment: Worker-level evidence (2014) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129 (4), pp. 1799-1860; Bennett, N.M., Environmental shocks (2015), https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5564&context=etd, A Study in Thailand Differentiated Households and Migration; Berube, A., Bateman, N., Who are the workers already impacted by the Covid-19 recession?

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. Study design: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. Methods: The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. Results: In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11–85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. Conclusions: Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found.

Bulgaria is no exception. Major uncertainties surround almost every aspect of human life: the infectiousness, prevalence, and lethality of the virus; the capacity of healthcare systems to meet the challenge; how long it will take to develop ‘herd immunity’; how long and how strong should social distancing be; how long it will take to develop and deploy safe, effective vaccines etc. On top of all this comes the economic uncertainty. There is no doubt the pandemic is having immediately visible effects on economic activity. The rapid contraction in economic activity, the collapse of trade, and the dramatic increase in the unemployment rate are without precedent. Our goal here is to assess the near-term macroeconomic effects of these COVID-induced uncertainties. To this end, we look at the measures taken worldwide and in the EU in particular, focusing on Bulgaria’s main trading partners. We develop three different scenarios for the economic development by the end of 2020 based on different assumptions with regard to the severity of the external shock as well as the duration of the social distancing.

Pediatric COVID-19 accounts for a small percentage of patients and is often milder than that in adults; however, it can progress to severe disease in some cases. Even neonates can suffer from COVID-19, and children may spread the disease in the community.

CRICS TRIGGERSEP Group (Clinical Research in Intensive Care and Sepsis Trial Group for Global Evaluation and Research in Sepsis)","Purpose: Little evidence of increased thrombotic risk is available in COVID-19 patients. Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. Results: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. Conclusion: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ARDS; Coagulopathy; COVID-19;

Objectives: To report the epidemiological and clinical futures of the 200 patients infected with COVID-19 in Yichang, Hubei Province, China. Study design: 200 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Yichang from Jan 30 to Feb 8, 2020 were investigated retrospectively. The epidemiological data and clinical characteristics were collected. The data between the ICU patients and non-ICU patients were compared. The patients were followed up till Feb 26, 2020. Results: Of the 200 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 98 (49.0 %) were male, and the mean age was 55 years. Eighty-seven (43.5 %) had no linkage to Wuhan or contact history. Familial clustering was found in 34 patients. Sixtyfive (32.5 %) suffered from chronic diseases. The common symptoms included fever (171[85.5 %]), cough (116[58.0 %]), and fatigue (64[32 %]). Most patients had lymphopenia. One hundred and seventy-two (86 %) patients showed typical imaging findings of viral pneumonia. Most patients received antiviral, antibiotic, and corticosteroid treatment. Compared with the non-ICU patients, 29 (14.5 %) patients in the ICU were older and more likely to show dyspnea and complications including ARDS. As of Feb 26, 15 (51.7 %) patients in the ICU had died. Conclusions: The COVID-19 infection was of clustering onset and can cause severe respiratory disease and even death. The mortality of ICU patients with COVID-19 was considerably high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical features; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2","antibiotic agent; antivirus agent; arbidol; C reactive protein; ceftriaxone; corticosteroid; D dimer; interleukin 6; lactate dehydrogenase; lopinavir plus ritonavir; moxifloxacin; oseltamivir; procalcitonin; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; antibiotic therapy; antiviral therapy; Article; artificial ventilation; chill; China; chronic disease; clinical feature; continuous renal replacement therapy; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; coughing; descriptive research; diarrhea; dyspnea; epidemiological data; fatigue; female; fever; headache; heart injury; hospital patient; human; hypoxemia; intensive care unit; kidney injury; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; malaise; male; middle aged; myalgia; nausea and vomiting; neutrophil count; noninvasive ventilation; oxygen therapy; priority journal; protein blood level; retrospective study; rigor; secondary infection; shock; sore throat; virus pneumonia",,"arbidol, 131707-23-8; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; ceftriaxone, 73384-59-5, 74578-69-1; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; moxifloxacin, 151096-09-2; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,,,,"Michaels, M.G., La Hoz, R.M., Danziger Isakov, L., Coronavirus disease 2019: implications of emerging infections for transplantation (2020) Am.

In this study, we estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths resulting from the potential disruption of health systems and decreased access to food. Methods: We modelled three scenarios in which the coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions is reduced by 9·8–51·9% and the prevalence of wasting is increased by 10–50%. Although our scenarios are hypothetical, we sought to reflect real-world possibilities, given emerging reports of the supply-side and demand-side effects of the pandemic. We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the additional maternal and under-5 child deaths under each scenario, in 118 low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated additional deaths for a single month and extrapolated for 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Findings: Our least severe scenario (coverage reductions of 9·8–18·5% and wasting increase of 10%) over 6 months would result in 253 500 additional child deaths and 12 200 additional maternal deaths. Our most severe scenario (coverage reductions of 39·3–51·9% and wasting increase of 50%) over 6 months would result in 1 157 000 additional child deaths and 56 700 additional maternal deaths. These additional deaths would represent an increase of 9·8–44·7% in under-5 child deaths per month, and an 8·3–38·6% increase in maternal deaths per month, across the 118 countries. Across our three scenarios, the reduced coverage of four childbirth interventions (parenteral administration of uterotonics, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants, and clean birth environments) would account for approximately 60% of additional maternal deaths. The increase in wasting prevalence would account for 18–23% of additional child deaths and reduced coverage of antibiotics for pneumonia and neonatal sepsis and of oral rehydration solution for diarrhoea would together account for around 41% of additional child deaths. Interpretation: Our estimates are based on tentative assumptions and represent a wide range of outcomes. Nonetheless, they show that, if routine health care is disrupted and access to food is decreased (as a result of unavoidable shocks, health system collapse, or intentional choices made in responding to the pandemic), the increase in child and maternal deaths will be devastating. We hope these numbers add context as policy makers establish guidelines and allocate resources in the days and months to come.

Complications on the intensive care units include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac, and kidney injury as well as shock. Here, we present the first case report of a successful treatment of a COVID-19 patient presenting with adult respiratory distress syndrome plus refractory combined cardiogenic and vasoplegic shock, which could be successfully stabilized after implantation of a percutaneous ventricular assist device plus an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although such intense treatment might not be feasible in case of a health care disaster as described for the hot spots of the COVID-19 pandemic, it might encourage treatment of younger patients on intensive care units not overcrowded by critically ill patients. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Based on preliminary clinical reports, hypoxic respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death. Further, septic shock, late-onset cardiac dysfunction, and multiorgan system failure are also described as contributors to overall mortality. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and other modalities of mechanical cardiopulmonary support are increasingly being utilized in the treatment of respiratory and circulatory failure refractory to conventional management, their role and efficacy as support modalities in the present pandemic are unclear. We review the rapidly changing epidemiology, pathophysiology, emerging therapy, and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019; and based on these data and previous experience with artificial cardiopulmonary support strategies, particularly in the setting of infectious diseases, provide consensus recommendations from American Society for Artificial Internal Organs. Of note, this is a living document, which will be updated periodically, as additional information and understanding emerges. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Materials and Methods: Baseline CT scans and clinical and laboratory data of 72 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (39 men, 46.2 ± 15.9 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline CT findings including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities, consolidation, linear opacities, and lung severity score were evaluated. The outcome event was recovery with hospital discharge. The time from symptom onset to discharge or the end of follow-up (for those remained hospitalized) was recorded. Data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values < 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge. Results: Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days). None died during the study period. After controlling for age, onset time, lesion characteristics, number of lung lobes affected, and bilateral involvement, the lung severity score on baseline CT (> 4 vs. ≤ 4 [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.41 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.18–0.92], p = 0.031) and initial lymphocyte count (reduced vs. normal or elevated [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.14 [95% CI = 0.03–0.60], p = 0.008) were two significant independent factors that influenced recovery and discharge. Conclusion: Lung severity score > 4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a significantly lower rate of recovery and discharge and extended hospitalization in patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.","2019-nCoV; Admission; Clinical course; Computed tomography; Coronavirus; COVID-19; CT; Discharge; Hospital stay; Hospitalization; Outcome; Pneumonia; Prediction; Prognosis; Recovery","alanine aminotransferase; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; hemoglobin; interferon; adult; Article; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; diarrhea; disease course; disease severity assessment; epidemic; female; fever; follow up; hazard ratio; headache; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; hypoxemia; image analysis; lung lobe; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; pleura effusion; septic shock; sore throat; thorax pain; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; disease exacerbation; pandemic; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,"alanine aminotransferase, 9000-86-6, 9014-30-6; aspartate aminotransferase, 9000-97-9; hemoglobin, 9008-02-0",,"Philips Healthcare, Netherlands","Ministry of Education, MOE: NCET-11-0438

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of AA and Latino Hispanic patients with COVID-19 admitted to a 665-bed quaternary care, teaching hospital located in Newark, New Jersey. The study included patients who had completed hospitalization between March 10, 2020, and April 10, 2020. We reviewed demographics, socioeconomic variables and incidence of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Logistic regression was used to identify predictor of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Out of 416 patients, 251 (60%) had completed hospitalization as of April 10, 2020. The incidence of In-hospital mortality was 38.6% (n = 97). Most common symptoms at initial presentation were dyspnea 39% (n = 162) followed by cough 38%(n = 156) and fever 34% (n = 143). Patients were in the highest quartile for population's density, number of housing units and disproportionately fell into the lowest median income quartile for the state of New Jersey. The incidence of septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) was 24% (n = 59), 21% (n = 52), 33% (n = 82) respectively. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were older age, lower serum Hemoglobin < 10 mg/dl, elevated serum Ferritin and Creatinine phosphokinase levels > 1200 U/L and > 1000 U/L. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from an inter-city hospital's experience with COVID-19 among underserved minority populations showed that, more than one of every three patients were at risk for in-hospital death or morbidity. Older age and elevated inflammatory markers at presentation were associated with in-hospital death.","African American; COVID-19; Hispanic, mortality, morbidity; Minority","African American; aged; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; ethnology; female; Hispanic; hospital; hospital mortality; hospitalization; human; incidence; intensive care unit; male; middle aged; minority group; New Jersey; pandemic; retrospective study; risk assessment; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; African Americans; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hispanic Americans; Hospital Mortality; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Incidence; Intensive Care Units; Male; Middle Aged; Minority Groups; New Jersey; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,14759276,,,"32522191","English","Int J Equity Health",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086355151

So, when an external crisis jeopardizes markets, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak, SMEs are hit with great force. Their so-called liability of smallness, a lack of resources that would shield them from outside shocks, worsens the situation. This manuscript conducts a literature study on 69 manuscripts that studied SMEs in previous crises and proposes ways to overcome economic downturns in the areas of finance, strategy and the institutional environment. The paper finds a “strategy/funding chicken-and-egg-problem” and proposes an effectual world view when dealing with situations of great uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Crisis; Small firms; SMEs; Strategy",,,,,,,,,"Anghel, L.-D., Constantinescu, M., Caescu, Ş.C., Innovation within the Strategic Marketing Management of Industrial Smes as a Response to the Economic Crisis (2013) Transformations in Business & Economics, 12 (1), pp. 412-428; Armstrong, A., Davis, E.P., Liadze, I., Rienzo, C., An assessment of bank lending to UK SMEs in the wake of the crisis (2013) National Institute Economic Review, 225 (1), pp. 39-51; Auzzir, Z., Haigh, R., Amaratunga, D., Impacts of disaster to SMEs in Malaysia (2018) Procedia engineering, 212, pp. 1131-1138; Balios, D., Daskalakis, N., Eriotis, N., Vasiliou, D., SMEs capital structure determinants during severe economic crisis: The case of Greece (2016) Cogent Economics & Finance, 4 (1), pp. 1-11; Barron, A., Hultén, P., Hudson, S., The financial crisis and the gathering of political intelligence: A cross-country comparison of SMEs in France, Sweden and the UK (2012) International Small Business Journal, 30 (4), pp. 345-366; Beliaeva, T., Shirokova, G., Wales, W., Gafforova, E., Benefiting from economic crisis?

More than one host-cell receptor is reported to be recognized by the viral spike protein, among them is the cell-surface Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), also termed GRP78 or BiP. Upon viral infection, HSPA5 is upregulated, then translocating to the cell membrane where it is subjected to be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 spike. In this study, some natural product compounds are tested against the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain β (SBDβ), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike.Methods: Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to test some natural compounds binding to HSPA5 SBDβ.Results: The results show high to a moderate binding affinity for the phytoestrogens (Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A), chlorogenic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, hydroxytyrosol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and some physiological hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cholesterol to the HSPA5 SBDβ. Based on its binding affinities, the phytoestrogens and estrogens are the best in binding HSPA5, hence may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the stressed cells.Conclusion: These compounds can be successful as anti-COVID-19 agents for people with a high risk of cell stress like elders, cancer patients, and front-line medical staff.","COVID-19; GRP78; HSPA5; Molecular dynamics simulation; Natural compounds; Peptide-protein docking",,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,15380254,,,"32340551","English","J.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: General paediatric department of a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: 21 children and adolescents (aged ≤18 years) with features of Kawasaki disease who were admitted to hospital between 27 April and 11 May 2020 and followed up until discharge by 15 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were clinical and biological data, imaging and echocardiographic findings, treatment, and outcomes. Nasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies to the virus. RESULTS: 21 children and adolescents (median age 7.9 (range 3.7-16.6) years) were admitted with features of Kawasaki disease over a 15 day period, with 12 (57%) of African ancestry. 12 (57%) presented with Kawasaki disease shock syndrome and 16 (76%) with myocarditis. 17 (81%) required intensive care support. All 21 patients had noticeable gastrointestinal symptoms during the early stage of illness and high levels of inflammatory markers. 19 (90%) had evidence of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive RT-PCR result in 8/21, positive IgG antibody detection in 19/21). All 21 patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 10 (48%) also received corticosteroids. The clinical outcome was favourable in all patients. Moderate coronary artery dilations were detected in 5 (24%) of the patients during hospital stay. By 15 May 2020, after 8 (5-17) days of hospital stay, all patients were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing outbreak of Kawasaki-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children and adolescents in the Paris area might be related to SARS-CoV-2. In this study an unusually high proportion of the affected children and adolescents had gastrointestinal symptoms, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, and were of African ancestry. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1; interleukin 6; macrophage inflammatory protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nucleotide binding oligomerization domain like receptor; retinoic acid inducible protein I; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; tumor necrosis factor; cytokine; autopsy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical feature; clinical practice; coronavirus disease 2019; critical illness; cytokine storm; disease severity; disseminated intravascular clotting; epidemic; human; hypertension; hypotension; hypothesis; immune response; lymphocytopenia; medical research; Note; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; receptor upregulation; sepsis; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shock; virus entry; Betacoronavirus; blood clotting disorder; complication; Coronavirus infection; endothelium; epithelium; immunology; inflammation; lung; macrophage; metabolism; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; sepsis; severity of illness index; shock; virology; virus pneumonia; Autopsy; Betacoronavirus; Blood Coagulation Disorders; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Cytokines; Endothelium; Epithelium; Humans; Inflammation; Lung; Macrophages; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sepsis; Severity of Illness Index; Shock",,"gamma interferon inducible protein 10, 97741-20-3; Cytokines",,,,,,"Guan, W.J., Ni, Z.Y., Hu, Y., Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China (2020) N Engl J Med, , published online Feb 28; Zhang, C., Shi, L., Wang, F.S., Liver injury in COVID-19: management and challenges (2020) Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol, , published online March 4; Singer, M., Deutschman, C.S., Seymour, C.W., The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) (2016) JAMA, 315, pp. 801-810; Zhou, F., Yu, T., Du, R., Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 1054-1062; Lin, G.L., McGinley, J.P., Drysdale, S.B., Pollard, A.J., Epidemiology and immune pathogenesis of viral sepsis (2018) Front Immunol, 9; Tian, S., Hu, W., Niu, L., Liu, H., Xu, H., Xiao, S.-Y., Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer (2020) J Thorac Oncol, , published online Feb 28; Xu, Z., Shi, L., Wang, Y., Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (2020) Lancet Respir Med, 8, pp. 420-422; Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China (trial version 7) https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/countries/china/covid-19-briefing-nhc/1-clinical-protocols-for-the-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-covid-19-v7.pdf?sfvrsn=c6cbfba4_2, (Accessed 14 April 2020); Yao, X.H., Li, T.Y., He, Z.C., A pathological report of three COVID-19 cases by minimally invasive autopsies (2020) Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi, 49, p.

SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus of approximately 160-80 nm in size and genomic size of approximately 27-35 kb which causes COVID-19. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue and muscle weakness, shortness of breath, sputum, headache, diarrhea and muscle inflammation. It causes death in the elderly, people with hypertension, a history of cardiovascular diseases, people with diabetes, cancer, impaired immune system, transplanted, and all people with immunocompromised weakness. Various studies have shown that three major events are respiratory disorders, lymphocytopenia, and cytokine storm as SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the ACE-2 receptor on the surface of alveolar type 2 lung cells; in which case, pneumonia, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock and even death occur because of the failure in the adjustment of inflammatory responses from immune system and proliferation of cytokines. As the virus enters the cells, receptors of intrinsic immune system-TLR3, TLR7 (endosomal receptors) and RIG-I and MDA-5 (cytosolic receptors) detects the RNA of the virus. Involvement of the receptors ends up with the production of different types of cytokines such as type I interferons and inflammation. In respect of acquired cellular immune system of Th1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocytes with cytokine production, the lymphocytes T CD8+ (CTL) play their part by producing perforin, granzyme and cytokine. Humoral-acquired immune activity can be determined in most patients by producing IgM (9 days after disease onset) and IgG (two weeks after disease onset). SARS-CoV-2 makes use of mechanisms such as disruption in the production of type I interferons, reduction of MHC-I, MHC-II expression, and increase of Tim-3 and PD-1 expression on the surface of CTL cells (T cell exhaustion) in order to evade the immune system. In this paper, we present a review of the most recent data on the immunopathogenic mechanisms of the infection with respiratory viruses, especially SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical management for septic shock and ARDS. Our case is unique in its atypical initial presentation and highlights the importance of early testing. © 2020 S.

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57–79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the “cytokine storm syndrome”, a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34–35 °C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40°–41 °C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8–5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death. © 2020","Aerosol vaporization and nebulization; Alcoholic gargle; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; IL-1/IL-6; Monoclonal antibody; Povidone-iodine gargle and eye drop; Remdesivir; SARS-CoV-2; Viral pneumonia","azithromycin; chloroquine; colchicine; heparin; metformin; nicotinamide riboside; rapamycin; remdesivir; ruxolitinib; tocilizumab; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; drug efficacy; drug structure; hospitalization; human; in vitro study; inhalational drug administration; nebulization; positive end expiratory pressure; public health service; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaporization",,"azithromycin, 83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4; chloroquine, 132-73-0, 3545-67-3, 50-63-5, 54-05-7; colchicine, 64-86-8; heparin, 37187-54-5, 8057-48-5, 8065-01-8, 9005-48-5; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; nicotinamide riboside, 1341-23-7; rapamycin, 53123-88-9; remdesivir, 1809249-37-3; ruxolitinib, 1092939-17-7, 941678-49-5; tocilizumab, 375823-41-9",,,,,,"Ylikoski, J.A., Savolainen, S.A., Jousimies-Somer, H., Bacterial flora in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity of healthy young men (1989) ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec, 51 (1), pp. 50-55; (2000), www.icsi.org, Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement.

Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. Results: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death. Older age and male sex were independent risk factors for poor outcome of the illness. Conclusions: A period of 7-13 days after illness onset is the critical stage in the COVID-19 course.

However, the recently reported hyperinflammatory syndrome with overlapping features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome—“Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2” (PIMS-TS) has caused concern. We describe cardiac findings and short-term outcomes in children with PIMS-TS at a tertiary children’s hospital. Single-center observational study of children with PIMS-TS from 10th April to 9th May 2020. Data on ECG and echocardiogram were retrospectively analyzed along with demographics, clinical features and blood parameters. Fifteen children with median age of 8.8 (IQR 6.4–11.2) years were included, all were from African/Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, Mixed or other minority ethnic groups. All showed raised inflammatory/cardiac markers (CRP, ferritin, Troponin I, CK and pro-BNP). Transient valve regurgitation was present in 10 patients (67%). Left Ventricular ejection fraction was reduced in 12 (80%), fractional shortening in 8 (53%) with resolution in all but 2. Fourteen (93%) had coronary artery abnormalities, with normalization in 6. ECG abnormalities were present in 9 (60%) which normalized in 6 by discharge. Ten (67%) needed inotropes and/or vasopressors. None needed extracorporeal life support. Improvement in cardiac biochemical markers was closely followed by improvement in ECG/echocardiogram. All patients were discharged alive and twelve (80%) have been reviewed since. Our entire cohort with PIMS-TS had cardiac involvement and this degree of involvement is significantly more than other published series and emphasizes the need for specialist cardiac review. We believe that our multi-disciplinary team approach was crucial for the good short-term outcomes. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Hyper-inflammatory; Kawasaki; MIS-C; PIMS-TS; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,,,,,"(2020) Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK, , https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/; Dong, Y., Mo, X., Hu, Y., Epidemiology of COVID-19 Among Children in China (2020) Pediatrics, , Epub ahead of print, 32179660; Docherty, A., Harrison, E., Green, C., Features of 20,133 UK patients in hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: prospective observational cohort study (2020) BMJ; Bertoncelli, D., Guidarini, M., Della Greca, A., COVID19: potential cardiovascular issues in pediatric patients (2020) Acta Biomed, 91 (2), pp. 177-183; Riphagen, S., Gomez, X., Gonzalez-Martinez, C., Hyperinflammatory shock in children during COVID-19 pandemic (2020) Lancet; Lu, X., Zhang, L., Du, H., SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children (2020) N Engl J Med, 382 (17), pp. 1663-1665; Wei, M., Yuan, J., Liu, Y., Novel Coronavirus infection in hospitalized infants under 1 year of age in China (2020) JAMA, 323 (13), pp. 1313-1314. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXnsFCqsL0%3D; Zimmermann, P., Curtis, N., Coronavirus infections in children including COVID-19: an overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prevention options in children (2020) Pediatr Infect Dis J, 39 (5), pp. 355-368; Paediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated with COVID-19, , https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/guidance-paediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome-temporally-associated-covid-19, Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health; https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html, Information for Paediatric Healthcare Providers; Subnational Population Projections for England: 2018-Based, , https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/bulletins/subnationalpopulationprojectionsforengland/2018based; https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/ethnic-groups, UK Government: List of ethnic groups; https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/guidance-paediatric-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome-temporally-associated-covid-19, Guidance: Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19.

Objectives The aim of the study was to identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with severe incidence of SARS.CoV.2 infection. Patients and methods All adult patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [37.58] years) consecutively admitted to the Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID.19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. Results A total of 108 patients with COVID.19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty.five patients (23.1%) developed severe disease, and of those 12 patients (48%) died. Advanced age, comorbidities (most commonly hypertension), higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher C.reactive protein level, D.dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of COVID.19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID.19 associated with higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.302.4.608; P = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8 × 109/l (OR, 9.017; 95% CI, 2.808.28.857; P &lt;0.001) on admission. Higher SOFA score (OR, 2.402; 95% CI, 1.313.4.395; P = 0.004) on admission was identified as risk factor for in.hospital death.

Methods: The novel coronavirus pneumonia TCM stage, clinical manifestations and the function of CGGD were analyzed by literature mining and clinical reports. TCMSP database was used to screen potential active components and related targets in CGGD. PubMed database was used to screen pneumonia, cough and fever related targets. With the help of Cytoscape software, a “drug-disease-target” visual network diagram and protein interaction network were constructed, and GO and pathway enrichment analysis of key targets was performed through the STRING database. The active ingredients were molecularly docked with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase protein and ACE2 by AutoDock Vina. Results: The analysis of the relationship between prescriptions and syndromes showed that CGGD could play warm-yang scattered cold, resolve dampness, clear stagnation and heat, and open up membrane’s power to intervene in early cold-dampness lung type COVID-19. Through screening, the therapeutic effects of CGGD were mainly in 156 chemical components acting on 159 related targets. The core 27 genes predicted and analyzed included EGFR, TP53, YWHAZ, HSP90AB1, PIK3R1, GRB2, etc. GO and pathway analysis showed that CGGD was mainly involved in biological processes such as cell regulation and immune system related pathways to play a therapeutic role. The 10 core components were molecularly docked, saikosaponin A, saikosaponin D, and peroxyergosterol in CGGD had good affinity with 3CL hydrolase protein and ACE2. Conclusion: Using network pharmacology and molecular docking technology to predict that CGGD can be used for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia with symptom of cold-dampness obstructing lungs in early stage, potential antiviral ingredients contained in prescription of CGGD, can play a therapeutic role in the treatment of new type of coronavirus pneumonia in the early stage by regulating the immune system. It explains the characteristics of “multi-component-multi-target-multi-disease” of Chinese materia medica, and provides theoretical basis for clinical rational use of medicines. © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

However, our understanding of the clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill pediatric patients and their ability of transmitting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 still remains inadequate because only a handful pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of critically ill infant were recorded. RESULTS: The infant had life-threatening clinical features including high fever, septic shock, recurrent apnea, petechiae and acute kidney injury and persistent declined CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The duration of nasopharyngeal virus shedding lasted for 49 days even with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir for 8 days. The CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was partially recovered 68 days post onset of the disease. Accumulating of effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+TEM) was observed among T-cell compartment. The nucleic acid tests and serum antibody for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 of the infant's mother who kept intimate contact with the infant were negative despite no strict personal protection. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was the typical feature of critically ill infant with COVID-19.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials. © 2020 Sociedad Española de Anestesiología, Reanimación y Terapéutica del Dolor","Aerosol-generating procedures; High-flow nasal therapy; Infection control; Non-invasive mechanical ventilation","adult respiratory distress syndrome; Betacoronavirus; complication; consensus; Coronavirus infection; human; noninvasive ventilation; pandemic; practice guideline; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Noninvasive Ventilation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult",,,,,,,,"https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Protocolo_manejo_clinico_COVID-19.pdf, Ministerio de Sanidad.

While its major manifestation is in the respiratory tract, the general extent of organ involvement as well as microscopic changes in the lungs remain insufficiently characterised. Autopsies are essential to elucidate COVID-19-associated organ alterations. Methods: This study reports autopsy findings of 21 COVID-19 patients hospitalised at the University Hospital Basel and at the Cantonal Hospital Baselland, Switzerland. An in-corpore technique was performed to ensure optimal staff safety. Results: The primary cause of death was respiratory failure with exudative diffuse alveolar damage with massive capillary congestion often accompanied by microthrombi despite anticoagulation. Ten cases showed superimposed bronchopneumonia. Further findings included pulmonary embolisms (n=4), alveolar haemorrhage (n=3) and vasculitis (n=1). Pathologies in other organ systems were predominantly attributable to shock; three patients showed signs of generalised thrombotic microangiopathy. Six patients were diagnosed with senile cardiac amyloidosis upon autopsy. Most patients suffered from one or more comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus). Additionally, there was an overall predominance of males and individuals with blood group A (81% and 65%, respectively). All relevant histological slides are linked as open-source scans in supplementary files. Conclusions: This study provides an overview of post-mortem findings in COVID-19 cases, implying that hypertensive, elderly, obese, male individuals with severe cardiovascular comorbidities as well as those with blood group A may have a lower threshold of tolerance for COVID-19. This provides a pathophysiological explanation for higher mortality rates amongst these patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Our main findings are as follows: (1) there is substantial heterogeneity in financial readiness, with lowest-income, least-educated, unemployed, and Black consumers most likely to have $0 saved for emergency expenses; (2) the amount of emergency savings is correlated with payment choice: Less financially prepared individuals use cash more and credit cards less, compared to those with higher emergency savings; (3) while people with low emergency savings rely more on cash than credit cards, they revolve more debt, and so a financial shock is costlier for them; (4) changes in income from one year to the next do not appear to affect the likelihood of revolving on credit cards or increase the amount borrowed, although the data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. For those with little or no savings and already financially vulnerable, even a temporary financial shock—an unexpected negative income shock (such as a layoff or a short-term government shutdown) or an unexpected expenditure (such as a medical expense or a car repair)—could have severe financial consequences, exacerbated by the high cost of borrowing on credit cards.

Successful therapeutic strategies in our case suggest timely initiating PE treatment followed by IVIG in critically ill patients with COVID-19 may prevent the disease from worsening and help to reduce the requirements for mechanical ventilation and intensive supportive care.

Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19. METHODS. In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. RESULTS. The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-γ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%). CONCLUSION. The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION. This is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.

METHODS: The clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated in the Second People' Hospital of Fuyang City from January 20th to February 18th in 2020 were retrospective analyzed, including the demographic and epidemiological date, vital signs and hematology indexes, etc. on admission. Patients were divided into the normal type (set as normal group) and severe/critical type (set as severe group) according to the COVID-19 treatment plan classification standard published by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. The differences between two groups were compared, and the variables with statistical significance were incorporated in the multivariate binary unconditional Logistic regression analysis to screen the risk factors of severe/critical type. Risk factors were summarized to establish an early warning model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out to evaluate the significance of the early warning model in the screening of critically COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with COVID-19 were admitted, including 125 patients of normal type and 30 patients of severe/critical type. (1) Compared with normal group, patients in severe group were older, and with higher proportion of basic diseases, higher body mass index (BMI), higher incidence of tachypnea, persistent high fever, peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 0.95, while the white blood cell count (WBC), CD4+T lymphocyte, CD8+T lymphocyte, lymphocyte count (LYM) were decreased obviously, the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid a protein (SAA), and CT showed higher incidence of multi-pulmonary lobe lesions. There were no significant differences of gender, travel history from Wuhan, smoking history, shock index (SI) and CD4+/CD8+ ratio between the two groups. (2) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years old [odds ratio (OR) = 1.620, P = 0.031], combined with underlying diseases (OR = 1.521, P = 0.044), persistent high fever (OR = 2.469, P = 0.014), WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L (OR = 3.079, P = 0.006), pulmonary multilobar lesions (OR = 1.367, P = 0.047), and IL-6 ≥ 30 ng/L (OR = 2.426, P = 0.010) were the risk factors of severe/critical COVID-19. (3) The OR value corresponding to each risk factors were scored by rounding. Two points were scored for age ≥ 60 years old, with underlying diseases, persistent high fever and IL-6 ≥ 30 ng/L, 3 points for WBC < 2.0×109/L and/or LYM < 0.4×109/L, 1 point for pulmonary multilobar lesions, and totally calculated as early warning model scores. The early warning model score of the severe group was significantly higher than that of the normal group (9.33±2.79 vs. 5.04±2.38, t = 9.010, P = 0.001). (4) The ROC curve analysis showed the area under ROC curve (AUC) of early warning model on the early screening of severe/critical patients in COVID-19 was 0.944, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.903-0.985; and the sensitivity and specificity were 93.3% and 72.0% respectively while the cut-off was 6.5. CONCLUSIONS: There are many differences between severe/critical and mild COVID-19 patients. The establishment of early warning model could help to screen severe/critical patients at an early stage, with certain significance for guiding treatment.",,"Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; human; pandemic; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve",,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,20954352,,,"32527341","Chinese","Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086424345

Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been discovered so far, including HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU115, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. At the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis. In this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.

Our aim is to report on the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses of COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-centre, case series of 136 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at Wuhan Third Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 28 January 2020 and 12 February 2020. The clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, treatment features and prognoses were summarized. Results and discussion: The 136 patients were divided into a moderate (M) group (n = 103, 75.7%) and a severe and critical (SC) group (n = 33, 24.3%). There were significant differences in the incidences of concomitant chronic medical illnesses (eg, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease), fever, dry cough and dyspnoea among the two groups (P <.05). Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P <.05). The main therapeutic drugs were antivirals, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, immunomodulators, traditional Chinese medicine preparations and symptomatic support drugs. There were significant differences in the incidences of shock, myocardial injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and renal injury among the two groups (P <.05). Among the 136 patients, 99 (72.7%) were cured, 14 (10.3%) were transferred to other hospital and 23 (16.9%) died. What is new and conclusion: Elderly patients with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe or critical COVID-19 with multiple organ damage or systemic injuries. The improvement of LYM and CRP may be associated with the prognoses of COVID-19. The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored. Throughout a patient's hospitalization, their treatment plan should be evaluated and adjusted according to their vital signs, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests and imaging changes.

Some of the CoVs are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans. In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of CoV that was named SARS-CoV-2 (standing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which has been classified as a high-consequence infectious disease. In addition, serious complications related to COVID-19 have been reported in some patients. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The pharmacist, as a healthcare practitioner, can play an important role in hindering the spread of COVID-19, and can be an active participant in national and community efforts to fight and contain this outbreak. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,,,,,,,"International Pharmaceutical Federation, Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak: Information and Guidelines for Pharmacists and the Pharmacy Workforce (2020); National Health Service (NHS), Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Standard Operating Procedure (Community Pharmacy) (2020), Version 1.0; APhA, Coronavirus: resources for pharmacists and an interview with a virus expert (2020) Pharm Today, , www.pharmacist.com/coronavirus, Accessed online on 6 Mar 2020 at; ASHP, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resources https://www.ashp.org/Pharmacy-Practice/Resource-Centers/Coronavirus, Accessed online on 20 Mar 2020 at; (2020) Infection Prevention and Control during Health Care when COVID-19 Is Suspected, Interim Guidance, , https://www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-prevention-and-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)-infection-is-suspected-20200125, World Health Organization Accessed online on 21 Mar 2020 at; Nessel, J., Clinical pharmacists play active roles in coronavirus preparation efforts (2020) Pharm Times; Clews, G., NHS England advises pharmacies to prepare ‘isolation space’ for patients with suspected COVID-19 (2020) Pharmaceut J; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=2019nCoV&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=, Accessed online 10 Feb 2020 at; Gao, J., Tian, Z., Yang, X., Breakthrough: Chloroquine Phosphate has Shown Apparent Efficacy in Treatment of COVID-19-Associated Pneumonia in Clinical Studies (2020), BioScience Trends Advance Publication; Cao, B., Wang, Y., Wen, D., A trial of lopinavir–ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19 (2020) N Engl J Med; Wan, Y., Shang, J., Graham, R., Baric, R.S., Li, F., Receptor recognition by the novel coronavirus from Wuhan: an analysis based on decade-long structural studies of SARS coronavirus (2020) J Virol, 94. , e00127-20; The International Pharmaceutical Federation, FIP Position Statement on the Association between the Use of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Medicines (Including Ibuprofen), ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Corticosteroids, and an Increased Risk of coronavirus/COVID-19 Infection or Disease Severity (2020), https://www.fip.org/files/content/priority-areas/coronavirus/FIP-Position-Statement-COVID-19-medicines.pdf, Accessed online on 21 Mar 2020 at; Stevens, P., Patel and P.

Prior research suggests that SMEs use bricolage to cope with such negative external shocks. While there is a rich discussion on how SMEs carry out their bricolage processes, the literature provides little empirical evidence on what actually happens in times of crisis. To examine whether the SME bricolage process described in the literature is consistent with how SMEs use bricolage when they face a business environment crisis, we conducted a qualitative study of six SMEs’ response to the austerity measures of the bailout programme for Greece, scheduled by the EU, ECB and IMF, which were known to have unambiguously led to the deterioration of the SME business environment. We found that bricolage occurred across all SMEs’ activities as expected. However, contrary to the literature, we found that bricolage did not lead the strategic approach of any of the investigated SMEs. Rather, bricolage was integrated within their overall strategy. Furthermore, we found that how the bricolage is unrolled depends on the SME sector. With this knowledge, the present study suggests policymakers need to adjust their support system towards enabling resource-constrained SMEs to deal with the aftermath of negative shocks in their business environment. © 2020, © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.","bricolage entrepreneurial; crise; crisis; entrepreneurial bricolage; entrepreneuriat; Entrepreneurship; environnement sans ressources; PME; SMEs",,,,,,,,,"Anderson, A.R., Ullah, F., The Condition of Smallness: How What It Means to Be Small Deters Firms from Getting Bigger (2014) Management Decision, 52 (2), pp. 326-349; Apostolopoulos, N., Newbery, R., Gkartzios, M., Social Enterprise and Community Resilience: Examining a Greek Response to Turbulent Times (2019) Journal of Rural Studies, 70, pp. 215-224; Ardagna, S., Caselli, F., The Political Economy of the Greek Debt Crisis: A Tale of Two Bailouts (2014) American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 6 (4), pp. 291-323; Bacq, S., Ofstein, L.F., Kickul, J.R., Gundry, L.K., Bricolage in Social Entrepreneurship: How Creative Resource Mobilization Fosters Greater Social Impact (2015) The International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, 16 (4), pp. 283-289; Baker, T., Miner, A.S., Eesley, D.T., Improvising Firms: Bricolage, account Giving and Improvisational Competencies in the Founding Process (2003) Research Policy, 32 (2), pp. 255-276; Baker, T., Nelson, R.E., Creating Something from Nothing: Resource Construction through Entrepreneurial Bricolage (2005) Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (3), pp. 329-366; Balios, D., Daskalakis, N., Eriotis, N., Vasiliou, D., SMEs Capital Structure Determinants during Severe Economic Crisis: The Case of Greece (2016) Cogent Economics & Finance, 4 (1); Bhidé, A., (2000) The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses, , UK: Oxford University Press; Dana, L.P., Dana, T.E., Expanding the Scope of Methodologies Used in Entrepreneurship Research (2005) International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business, 2 (1), pp. 79-88; Desa, G., Resource Mobilization in International Social Entrepreneurship: Bricolage as a Mechanism of Institutional Transformation (2012) Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 36 (4), pp. 727-751; Desa, G., Basu, S., Optimization or Bricolage?

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of infected patients in urban communities in the US are limited. Objectives: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to perform a comparative analysis of hospitalized and ambulatory patient populations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is a case series of 463 consecutive patients with COVID-19 evaluated at Henry Ford Health System in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, from March 9 to March 27, 2020. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2020. Exposure: Laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical presentation, complications, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Results: Of 463 patients with COVID-19 (mean [SD] age, 57.5 [16.8] years), 259 (55.9%) were female, and 334 (72.1%) were African American. Most patients (435 [94.0%]) had at least 1 comorbidity, including hypertension (295 patients [63.7%]), chronic kidney disease (182 patients [39.3%]), and diabetes (178 patients [38.4%]). Common symptoms at presentation were cough (347 patients [74.9%]), fever (315 patients [68.0%]), and dyspnea (282 patients [60.9%]). Three hundred fifty-five patients (76.7%) were hospitalized; 141 (39.7%) required intensive care unit management and 114 (80.8%) of those patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.2; P = .001), severe obesity (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-3.6; P = .02), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.3; P = .006) were independently associated with intensive care unit admission. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit had longer length of stay and higher incidence of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, shock, and mortality (57 patients [40.4%] vs 15 patients [7.0%]) compared with patients in the general practice unit. Twenty-nine (11.2%) of those discharged from the hospital were readmitted and, overall, 20.0% died within 30 days. Male sex (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1; P = .03) and age older than 60 years (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.9-9.7; P < .001) were significantly associated with mortality, whereas African American race was not (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.54-1.8; P = .86).

There has been an urgent need to determine clinical characteristics of Polish patients with laboratory.confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS.CoV.2) infection in the clinical setting. Objecti ves The aim of this retrospective study was to outline characteristics and short.term outcomes of SARS.CoV.2. positive patients. Patient s and methods We retrospectively assessed 169 consecutive patients with laboratory.confirmed COVID.19 with regard to their clinical manifestations, radiological findings, treatment, complications, and outcomes. Result s Of the 169 patients, more than half was aged 65 years or older (88; 52.1%), 51.5% were male, and 78.3% had comorbidities. The majority of patients (106; 62.7%) were transferred from outbreak locations in medical facilities. The most common symptoms on admission were fever (42%), shortness of breath (35%), and fatigue (33%). Twenty seven (15.4%) patients required intensive care unit admission. Overall mortality was 26.3% (n = 46) and was significantly higher in patients transferred from other facilities (38 out of 106; 35.8%), than in patients admitted directly to the hospital (8 out of 63; 12.69%; P <0.001). Seventeen out of 29 patients admitted to the intensive care unit died (mortality, 58.6%), including 30 out of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.2% mortality rate). Conclusions Polish patients with COVID.19 have similar characteristics and risk factors for adverse outcomes to those observed in countries in which outbreaks occurred earlier. Significantly higher mortality in patients transferred from other centers warrants special attention and transfer policy should be verified. © 2020 Medycyna Praktyczna.

Three crises—the 9/11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic—forced American policy makers to diverge from this paradigm. At the time, these divergences were described as temporary departures from normalcy. In retrospect, it would be more accurate to regard the millennial paradigm itself as the abnormality: a model of governance designed for rare moments of calm. In the last two decades, a different paradigm has emerged. American government has become the ultimate bearer of societal risks. Repeatedly, it has adopted extraordinary measures to protect public safety and the economy. However, the American state lacks the capacity to anticipate and manage these massive risks competently. New capabilities are required, along with a new mentality about governing. Domestic politics will complicate the task of building these capabilities. © 2020 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,,,,,,,,"Allison, G.T., (2017) Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?, , Boston, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Ansell, C., (2019) The Protective State, , Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Arnold, P.E., (1998) Making the Managerial Presidency: Comprehensive Reorganization Planning, 1905–1996, , Lawrence, University Press of Kansas; (2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm, Federal Reserve Announces Extensive New Measures to Support the Economy.

There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination. © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.",,"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; human; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans",,"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,00045772,,,"32138488","English","J Assoc Physicians India",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081531589

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China and spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling by air. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop to the acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human-to-human. Therefore, high-risk aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne PPE should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,10019294,,,"32102726","English","Chin. Med. Sci.

We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea. Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years. Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days. Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus. The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care. All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir). Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%). In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%). Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients. As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%.

This is a case series performed at 4 academic tertiary care centers in Paris of all the children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with shock, fever and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 15th and April 27th, 2020. Results: 20 critically ill children admitted for shock had an acute myocarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35% (25–55); troponin, 269 ng/mL (31–4607)), and arterial hypotension with mainly vasoplegic clinical presentation. The first symptoms before PICU admission were intense abdominal pain and fever for 6 days (1–10). All children had highly elevated C-reactive protein (> 94 mg/L) and procalcitonin (> 1.6 ng/mL) without microbial cause. At least one feature of Kawasaki disease was found in all children (fever, n = 20, skin rash, n = 10; conjunctivitis, n = 6; cheilitis, n = 5; adenitis, n = 2), but none had the typical form. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were positive for 10 and 15 children, respectively. One child had both negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology, but had a typical SARS-CoV-2 chest tomography scan. All children but one needed an inotropic/vasoactive drug support (epinephrine, n = 12; milrinone, n = 10; dobutamine, n = 6, norepinephrine, n = 4) and 8 were intubated. All children received intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g per kilogram) with adjuvant corticosteroids (n = 2), IL 1 receptor antagonist (n = 1) or a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor (n = 1). All children survived and were afebrile with a full left ventricular function recovery at PICU discharge. Conclusions: Acute myocarditis with intense systemic inflammation and atypical Kawasaki disease is an emerging severe pediatric disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early recognition of this disease is needed and referral to an expert center is recommended. A delayed and inappropriate host immunological response is suspected. While underlying mechanisms remain unclear, further investigations are required to target an optimal treatment. © 2020, The Author(s).","Acute myocarditis; Children; Multisystem inflammatory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2; Shock","brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; corticosteroid; dobutamine; epinephrine; immunoglobulin; milrinone; noradrenalin; procalcitonin; troponin; abdominal pain; acute kidney failure; adolescent; Article; artificial ventilation; cardiogenic shock; cheilitis; child; clinical article; conjunctivitis; coronavirus disease 2019; critically ill patient; female; fever; heart left ventricle function; hospital admission; human; hypotension; male; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; multiple organ failure; myocarditis; observational study; pediatric intensive care unit; preschool child; priority journal; rash; retrospective study; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tertiary care center; transthoracic echocardiography; vasoplegia",,"brain natriuretic peptide, 114471-18-0; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; dobutamine, 34368-04-2, 52663-81-7, 49745-95-1, 61661-06-1; epinephrine, 51-43-4, 55-31-2, 6912-68-1; immunoglobulin, 9007-83-4; milrinone, 78415-72-2; noradrenalin, 1407-84-7, 51-41-2; procalcitonin, 56645-65-9",,,,,,"Lu, X., Zhang, L., Du, H., Zhang, J., Li, Y.Y., Qu, J., SARS-CoV-2 infection in children (2020) N Engl J Med., 382, pp. 1663-1665; Tagarro, A., Epalza, C., Santos, M., Sanz-Santaeufemia, F.J., Otheo, E., Moraleda, C., Screening and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children in Madrid, Spain (2020) JAMA Pediatr, , https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2764394, Accessed 12 Apr 2020; Castagnoli, R., Votto, M., Licari, A., Brambilla, I., Bruno, R., Perlini, S., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review (2020) JAMA Pediatr; Inciardi, R.M., Lupi, L., Zaccone, G., Italia, L., Raffo, M., Tomasoni, D., Cardiac Involvement in a Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2020) JAMA Cardiol, , https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763843Accessed7May2020; Madjid, M., Safavi-Naeini, P., Solomon, S.D., Vardeny, O., Potential Effects of Coronaviruses on the Cardiovascular System: A Review (2020) JAMA Cardiol, , https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763846Accessed7May2020; Shi, S., Qin, M., Shen, B., Cai, Y., Liu, T., Yang, F., Association of Cardiac Injury With Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China (2020) JAMA Cardiol, , https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763524Accessed7May2020; Liu, P.P., Blet, A., Smyth, D., Li, H., The science underlying COVID-19: implications for the cardiovascular system (2020) Circulation.; (2019) Congenital Heart Disease - Wiley Online Library, , https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/chd.12835, Accessed 7 May 2020; Weiss, S.L., Peters, M.J., Alhazzani, W., Agus, M.S.D., Flori, H.R., Inwald, D.P., Surviving sepsis campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children (2020) Intensive Care Med, 46, pp. 10-67. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXkt1ertbg%3D; Zhu, H., Rhee, J.-W., Cheng, P., Waliany, S., Chang, A., Witteles, R.M., Cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19: consequences of viral toxicities and host immune response (2020) Curr Cardiol Rep., 22, p. 32; Leisman, D.E., Deutschman, C.S., Legrand, M., Facing COVID-19 in the ICU: vascular dysfunction, thrombosis, and dysregulated inflammation (2020) Intensive Care Med., 1, pp. 1-4; Tomelleri, A., Sartorelli, S., Campochiaro, C., Baldissera, E.M., Dagna, L., Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with large-vessel vasculitis in Italy: a monocentric survey (2020) Ann Rheum Dis; McCrindle, B.W., Rowley, A.H., Newburger, J.W., Burns, J.C., Bolger, A.F., Gewitz, M., Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease: a scientific statement for health professionals from the American heart association (2017) Circulation, 135, pp. e927-e999; Kanegaye, J.T., Wilder, M.S., Molkara, D., Frazer, J.R., Pancheri, J., Tremoulet, A.H., Recognition of a Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (2009) Pediatrics, 123, pp. e783-e789; Gatterre, P., Oualha, M., Dupic, L., Iserin, F., Bodemer, C., Lesage, F., Kawasaki disease: an unexpected etiology of shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (2012) Intensive Care Med, 38, pp. 872-878","Oualha, M.; Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Necker-Enfants-Malades University Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris University, EA7323, France; email: mehdi.oualha@aphp.fr",,,"Springer",,,,,21105820,,,,"English","Ann.

To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; DSGE modeling; housing market; inbound tourism; rental market",,,,,,"Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, JUFE: K62192012

While a detailed longer-term diffusion path of the new virus cannot be anticipated for individual countries, one may anticipate international supply shocks and declining GDP growth in many OECD countries and China in 2020; and one should expect falling asset prices in Asia, the United States and the European Union plus the United Kingdom – except for the price of risk-free government bonds. In the course of 2020/21 the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other countries, will face both an increasing number of infected patients as well as a higher case fatality ratio. Health care expenditures in the US could increase more than in the Eurozone and the EU in the medium term, a development that undermines the international competitiveness of the United States. The analysis suggests that per capita income is a positive function of the effective trade openness and of the new Global Health Security Index indicator from the NTI/Johns Hopkins University. A rising health care-GDP ratio in the US is equivalent to a rising US export tariff. As regards the coronavirus challenge, the ratio of acute care beds to the elderly in OECD countries shows considerable variation. Due to international tourism contraction alone, output growth in the Eurozone, the US and China can be expected to fall by about 1.6% in 2020. The COVID-19 challenge for the US Trump Administration is a serious one, since the lack of experts in the Administration will become more apparent in such a systemic stress situation – and this might well affect the November 2020 US presidential election which, in turn, would itself have considerable impacts on the UK and the EU27 as well as EU-UK trade negotiations. Integrating the health care sector into macroeconomics, which should include growth analysis, is an important task. The role of health quality - and health insurance coverage - for endogenous time horizons and economic welfare, respectively, is emphasized. © 2020, The Author(s).","China; Coronavirus; EU; Health system; Macroeconomics; US",,,,,,"Georgetown University

To establish the various effects of the coronavirus on the economy and protective equipment, as well as probable transmission channels. Methods. Mathematical, empirical, systemic, analytical, economic and other approaches are used to study the development of the world market in the conditions of the coronavirus disease. Results. We give a brief description of the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick epidemic model, corresponding to the general nature of the current coronavirus epidemic, that can dramatically change the global market development scenario. We show three scenarios for the global economy development. Quick recovery implies a slowdown in economic growth in the United States and Europe will end by the end of March; China is likely to recover by the end of April, and demand will recover relatively quickly. Global slowdown implies the economy will recover at the end of the second quarter, but global GDP growth in 2020 will drop to 1…1.5 percent. Global pandemic implies a serious shock to the global economy, which can last for almost a year. Conclusion. Three scenarios of the world economy development in the context of the coronavirus crisis are formulated, as well as the various effects of the coronavirus disease on the world economy are identified; remedies are proposed. We concluded that the coronavirus disease will affect microeconomic heritage, macroeconomic heritage and political heritage. Multilaterally, the crisis can be interpreted as a call for increased cooperation or, on the contrary, a need to expand the bipolar centers of geopolitical power. We list a number of mathematical papers with extensive bibliography on COVID-19. On the example of one of such works we have shown that the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick model remains the backbone of the research in this sphere. © 2020, Saratov State University.

The combination of model-based and data-driven approaches allows uncovering the interrelations of risk data, disruption modeling, and performance assessment. The SC shocks and adaptations amid the COVID-19 pandemic along with post-pandemic recoveries provide indisputable evidences for the urgent needs of digital twins for mapping supply networks and ensuring visibility.

This study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients who succumbed to and who recovered from 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. A retrospective investigation was conducted to analyze the clinical characteristics of fatal cases of COVID-19 (death group) and we compare them with recovered patients (recovered group). Continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed by χ test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 109 COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization and 116 recovered patients. The median age of the death group was older than the recovered group (69 [62, 74] vs. 40 [33, 57] years, Z = 9.738, P < 0.001). More patients in the death group had underlying diseases (72.5% vs. 41.4%, χ = 22.105, P < 0.001). Patients in the death group had a significantly longer time of illness onset to hospitalization (10.0 [6.5, 12.0] vs. 7.0 [5.0, 10.0] days, Z = 3.216, P = 0.001). On admission, the proportions of patients with symptoms of dyspnea (70.6% vs. 19.0%, χ = 60.905, P < 0.001) and expectoration (32.1% vs. 12.1%, χ = 13.250, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group. The blood oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the death group (85 [77, 91]% vs. 97 [95, 98]%, Z = 10.625, P < 0.001). The white blood cell (WBC) in death group was significantly higher on admission (7.23 [4.87, 11.17] vs. 4.52 [3.62, 5.88] ×10/L, Z = 7.618, P < 0.001). Patients in the death group exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count (0.63 [0.40, 0.79] vs. 1.00 [0.72, 1.27] ×10/L, Z = 8.037, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte percentage (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 23.50 [15.27, 31.25]%, Z = 10.315, P < 0.001) on admission, and the lymphocyte percentage continued to decrease during hospitalization (7.10 [4.45, 12.73]% vs. 2.91 [1.79, 6.13]%, Z = 5.242, P < 0.001). Alanine transaminase (22.00 [15.00, 34.00] vs. 18.70 [13.00, 30.38] U/L, Z = 2.592, P = 0.010), aspartate transaminase (34.00 [27.00, 47.00] vs. 22.00 [17.65, 31.75] U/L, Z = 7.308, P < 0.001), and creatinine levels (89.00 [72.00, 133.50] vs. 65.00 [54.60, 78.75] μmol/L, Z = 6.478, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the death group than those in the recovered group. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also significantly higher in the death group on admission (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 3.22 [1.04, 21.80] mg/L, Z = 10.206, P < 0.001) and showed no significant improvement after treatment (109.25 [35.00, 170.28] vs. 81.60 [27.23, 179.08] mg/L, Z = 1.219, P = 0.233). The patients in the death group had more complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (89.9% vs. 8.6%, χ = 148.105, P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (59.6% vs. 0.9%, χ = 93.222, P < 0.001), acute kidney injury (18.3% vs. 0%, χ = 23.257, P < 0.001), shock (11.9% vs. 0%, χ = 14.618, P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (6.4% vs. 0%, χ = 7.655, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the recovered group, more patients in the death group exhibited characteristics of advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities, dyspnea, oxygen saturation decrease, increased WBC count, decreased lymphocytes, and elevated CRP levels. More patients in the death group had complications such as ARDS, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, shock, and DIC.",,"C reactive protein; oxygen; adult; aged; Betacoronavirus; blood; complication; Coronavirus infection; female; human; male; middle aged; mortality; pandemic; retrospective study; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; C-Reactive Protein; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7; C-Reactive Protein; Oxygen",,,,,,,,,,"NLM (Medline)",,,,,25425641,,,"32209890","English","Chin.

In the case of this research the recession was sparked not by the shock of financial sector but by the restrictions imposed on consumption that previously was not inclined to fluctuate that much. Oil price shock has increased negative influence on the world energy market and economy overall. The decline in employment and personal consumption has struck more on most vulnerable social classes but the decreased volume of demand can be also attributed to the wealth (catering, tourism and others). Once began, the recession develops by its own rules - a sharp fall in the world trade, fixed capital formation, growth of budget deficits, and particularly strong impact on developing countries most dependent on tourism and financial assistance. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over. The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission. Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs. © 2020, Indian Academy of Pediatrics.","COVID-19; Guideline; Pandemic; SARI; Treatment","acute kidney failure; Article; blood cell count; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease burden; disease marker; emergency health service; health care management; human; India; intensive care unit; mixed infection; myocarditis; patient isolation; patient transport; pediatric intensive care unit; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; resuscitation; septic shock; sequence analysis; thorax radiography; child; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; health care planning; organization and management; pandemic; pediatric intensive care unit; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Health Resources; Humans; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",,,,,,,,"Wu, Z., McGoogan, J.M., Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak in China: Summary of a report of 72/ 314 cases from the Chinese center for disease control and prevention [published online ahead of print] (2020) JAMA, 10. , https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130, Available from, Accessed March 25, 2020,1001/jama.2020.2648; Shen, K., Yang, Y., Wang, T., Zhao, D., Jiang, Y., Jin, R., Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children: experts’ consensus statement (2020) World J Pediatr, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7; (2019), https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019, [Internet], [cited 2020 Mar 26].

Against this backdrop, the authors of this study investigate which offerings industrial customers are most likely to purchase as the pandemic progresses. Drawing on positive decision theory and empirically investigating 31,353 sales opportunities across 57 countries, the authors show that the coronavirus pandemic significantly decreases industrial customers' purchase probability, especially for high-priced offerings. In countries with low uncertainty avoidance and strong long-term orientation (e.g., China, India, Singapore), purchase probability is less affected by the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic even increases purchase probability for offerings with low prices in countries where cultures are simultaneously uncertainty-avoidant and short-term oriented (e.g., Argentina, Brazil, Mexico). This is presumably because customers safeguard their operations in the face of impending supply shortages. Consequently, this helps suppliers focus on the right sales opportunities to secure their business during exogenous global shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Hofstede; Industrial purchasing; National culture",,,,,,,,,"Baker, S., Farrokhnia, R., Meyer, S., Pagel, M., Yannelis, C., A closer look at consumer stockpiling during the coronavirus crisis (2020), https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/stockpiling-household-spending-coronavirus-covid-lockdown, Retrieved from (accessed 05/11/2020); Bell, D., Raiffa, H., Tversky, A., Descriptive, normative, and prescriptive interactions in decision making (1988) Decision making: Descriptive, normative, and prescriptive interactions, pp. 9-30. , D.

Two processes make markets and other economic systems more malleable during times of crises: (1) as the stasis of the market system is interrupted, it forces the system “into movement” - and it requires less effort to nudge an already moving system in a specific direction; and (2) as deeply-rooted mental models are challenged during crises, any market-shaping initiative which promises a credible end to current instability with a new equilibrium will appeal to the natural human craving for stability. This malleability, in turn, creates multiple opportunities for firms to shape their markets and hence drive the market's development in favorable directions. We outline a generic process of market-shaping, comprising eight steps: (1) determining whether to act now or actively wait, (2) deciding whether to be a shaper or a supporter, (3) developing a scalable vision for the future market, (4) recognizing the minimum viable system linked to this vision, (5) driving changes in market-level properties, (6) securing that value is quantified and shared, (7) inviting actor engagement for implementation, and (8) defending against possible retaliations from threatened market systems. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Crisis; Market shaping; Market systems; Minimum viable system; Shaping strategies; Timing",,,,,,"Royal Society of New Zealand","This research is funded by a Marsden grant ( UOA1333 ) from the Royal Society of New Zealand .",,"Adner, R., The wide Lens: A new strategy for innovation (2012), (Penguin UK); Adner, R., Ecosystem as structure: An actionable construct for strategy (2017) Journal of Management, 43 (1), pp. 39-58; Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: How the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strategic Management Journal, 31 (3), pp. 306-333; Argyris, C., Schön, D., Organizational learning: A theory of action perspective (1978), Addison-Wesley Reading MA; Baker, J.J., Nenonen, S., Collaborating to shape markets: Emergent collective market work (2020) Industrial Marketing Management, 85, pp. 240-253; Baker, J.J., Storbacka, K., Brodie, R.J., Markets changing, changing markets: Institutional work as market shaping (2019) Marketing Theory, 19 (3), pp. 301-328; Barczak, G., New product strategy, structure, process, and performance in the telecommunications industry (1995) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 12 (3), pp. 224-234; Barile, S., Polese, F., Smart service systems and viable service systems (2010) Service Science, 2 (1), pp. 21-40; Bingham, C.B., Eisenhardt, K.M., Rational heuristics: The “simple rules” that strategists learn from process experience (2011) Strategic Management Journal, 32 (13), pp. 1437-1464; Bocken, N.M., Short, S.W., Rana, P., Evans, S., A literature and practice review to develop sustainable business model archetypes (2014) Journal of Cleaner Production, 65, pp. 42-56; Brege, H., Kindström, D., Exploring proactive market strategies (2020) Industrial Marketing Management, 84, pp. 75-88; Brittain, J., Density-independent selection and community evolution (1994) Evolutionary Dynamics of Organizations, pp. 355-378. , J.

Some virus infections were found to be highly aggressive, leading to lung inflammation and severe damage in respiratory system with high fatality rate. Currently, there is no effective therapeutic drugs in the clinic. The common clinical symptoms of viral pneumonias include fever, rhinitis, runny nose, nonproductive cough, fatigue, myalgias and headaches after the immune system being tricked by driving cytokines and overactivated immune response induced by cytokine storms. Patients with severe symptoms could get persistent high fever, dysfunctional breathing, consciousness disorders and even respiratory failure, post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, multi-organ damages, shock and so on. Most clinical treatments are used to inhibit virus replication, relieve symptoms, inhibit excessive inflammatory response, regulate immune balance and protect organs. Both applied and basic research demonstrate that Chinese patent medicine has certain anti-viral effects, effectively inhibiting viral pneumonia transiting from mild to severe, rapid relieving of patient symptoms because of their multi-component and multi-target integrated roles. This review has summarized the reports on the treatment of viral pneumonia. Based on the pathogenic characteristics of viral pneumonia, this paper summarizes the diverse roles of the marketed Chinese patent medicine, such as their effects in inhibiting the progress of viral replication and overactivated inflammatory response, regulating immune balance, attenuating pulmonary fibrosis and so forth.

Methods: Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging findings. Results: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (ρ = −0.657, P < 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 ± 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and confirmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P < 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype. Conclusion: Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types. © 2020 The Author(s)","Clinical; Epidemiological; Imaging findings; Predictive factors; SRAS-CoV-2","albumin; antivirus agent; bilirubin; biological marker; C reactive protein; creatine kinase; creatinine; glucocorticoid; lactate dehydrogenase; oxygen; sodium; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; age; albumin blood level; Article; artificial ventilation; bilirubin blood level; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; corticosteroid therapy; coughing; creatine kinase blood level; creatinine blood level; diarrhea; disease severity; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; ground glass opacity; headache; hemoptysis; hospital admission; human; hypertension; intensive care unit; isolation; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; left lung; liver injury; lung consolidation; lung injury; lung lesion; lung lobe; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myalgia; nausea and vomiting; nonhuman; nose obstruction; onset age; oxygen therapy; oxygenation; prediction; retrospective study; right lung; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; shock; sodium blood level; sore throat; sputum; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; coughing; diagnostic imaging; fever; pandemic; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cough; Female; Fever; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Sputum; Young Adult",,"bilirubin, 18422-02-1, 635-65-4; C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; creatine kinase, 9001-15-4; creatinine, 19230-81-0, 60-27-5; lactate dehydrogenase, 9001-60-9; lactate dehydrogenase A; oxygen, 7782-44-7; sodium, 7440-23-5",,,"2017ZX10202202","National Major Science and Technology Research projects for the Control and Prevention of Major Infectious Diseases in China (2017ZX10202202).",,"Gorbalenya SCB, A.E., Baric, R.S., de Groot, R.J., Drosten, C., Gulyaeva, A.A., Haagmans, B.L., Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: the species and its viruses—a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group (2020) bioRxiv, , [Accessed 11 Mar 2020]; Biscayart, C., Angeleri, P., Lloveras, S., TdSS, C., Schlagenhauf, P., Rodriguez-Morales, A.J., The next big threat to global health? 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV): what advice can we give to travellers? - interim recommendations January 2020, from the Latin-American Society for Travel Medicine (SLAMVI) (2020) Travel Med Infect Dis; Cao, B., Li, X.W., Mao, Y., Wang, J., Lu, H.Z., Chen, Y.S., Clinical features of the initial cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in China (2009) N Engl J Med, 361 (26), pp. 2507-2517; Chen, N., Zhou, M., Dong, X., Qu, J., Gong, F., Han, Y., Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study (2020) Lancet; Chen, R.C., Tang, X.P., Tan, S.Y., Liang, B.L., Wan, Z.Y., Fang, J.Q., Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome with glucosteroids: the Guangzhou experience (2006) Chest, 129 (6), pp. 1441-1452; Chotpitayasunondh, T., Ungchusak, K., Hanshaoworakul, W., Chunsuthiwat, S., Sawanpanyalert, P., Kijphati, R., Human disease from influenza A (H5N1), Thailand, 2004 (2005) Emerg Infect Dis, 11 (2), pp. 201-209; Chung, M., Bernheim, A., Mei, X., Zhang, N., Huang, M., Zeng, X., CT imaging features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (2020) Radiology; Das, K.M., Lee, E.Y., Langer, R.D., Larsson, S.G., Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus: what does a radiologist need to know?

It argues that the inheritance of the UPA period was a combination of an unfolding “oligarchic capitalism” and a half-baked social democratic project. While the 2014 election victory was formally on a platform of “Minimum government, maximum governance” it always had deep ambiguities between a pro-business, pro-rules regime and an essentially nationalist project which subordinates commercial considerations. Some policy changes under this government, that we call Modi 1.0–notably the GST reform and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code–constitute potentially substantive shifts to an efficiency-improving and rules-based approach. However, their effectiveness has been compromised by substantial delays, additional administrative burdens and increased uncertainty, not least over the actual implementation of the new rules. All this coincided with the legacy of a severe overhang in the financial system. This contributed to a chilling effect on private corporate investment. It has also gone alongside a continued major role of public sector banks and PSUs in the economy. The combination of an apparent increased concentration of mega-deals in some of the largest business houses, and continued, if anything rising, importance of state-managed subcontracting for infrastructure, has further contributed to the sense of an, at best, half-baked effort to reform India’s capitalism. A top-down economic nationalist stance, state-driven action, political resistance to reforms, and attacks on accountability institutions, will actually continue to threaten long-run development dynamics. The demonetization episode was only the most vivid example of a growth-dampening policy. At the beginning of the new government–Modi 2.0–these contradictions are intensifying. With the Covid-19 shock, the associated tensions will only become sharper. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,,,"Chandra, R.; Harvard Kennedy SchoolUnited States; email: rchandra@cprindia.org",,,"Routledge",,,,,14736489,,,,"English","India Rev.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085183487
